00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.340
Welcome to Learn French with Paul Noble. Content copyright Paul Noble 2010.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.100
I'm Paul Noble. Over the years I have taught many, many people.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.420
Curiously, they have each had much the same story to tell regarding their previous experiences of language learning.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.940
As a result, these days, when I first start a teaching session, I ask my students to raise their hands if they have had any of the following experiences.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.060
Raise your hand, I say, if you studied a language for several years at school but came out unable to really say anything.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.100
Or, if you have ever bought a language course and given up around page 30, somewhere around chapter 2.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.460
Or, if you have ever felt more confused by a teacher's explanation of the language than by the language itself.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.220
Perhaps you've been amazed by just how closely grammar books resemble furniture assembly instructions.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.060
Or, you may have felt that you are in fact more or less incapable of learning a foreign language.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.100
Invariably, when asked these questions, all the students soon have at least one hand in the air.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.440
And they laugh.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.860
They laugh because for some reason, our language learning experiences tend to be very similar.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.800
And sadly, these similar experiences tend not to be very good ones.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.500
My own initial experiences of language learning were also uncannily similar to those I've just described.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.760
In fact, when I ask my students these questions, my own hand is the first to go up.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.040
And it stays up until we have gone through them all.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:07.220
However, these less than positive experiences have had an upside both for myself and for those individuals I have taught.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:16.340
Because these experiences, along with a number of other factors, have helped inform and shape the method that will be used during this course.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.020
Using this method, you will learn how to communicate in French and how to formulate your own ideas and thoughts using French.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:33.300
As you learn with it, you will quickly discover that I do not use complicated grammatical explanations at all.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.000
And I will not ask you to memorise long lists of vocabulary.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.760
The way the course is structured will by itself ensure that you remember what you are taught.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:54.680
Instead, through your interaction with the CDs, I will lead you through the French language, enabling you to build up complex sentences by yourself, step by step.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.960
So that you are actually speaking independently in French by the end of the course.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.160
And this is regardless of how little or how much you know when you begin.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.720
You will also discover that the language I teach is designed to be adaptable.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.580
So you will be able to use it just as easily for holidaying in a French-speaking country as for living or working in one.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.480
It will be just as easy to use it to order a coffee as to hold a conversation with the waiter who brings it to you.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.440
And again, all of this regardless of how little or how much you know when you begin.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:40.580
This method has already proved extremely successful with a very great many students, including hundreds of so-called no-hopers.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.840
Interestingly, not one of these students failed to learn using this method.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:55.520
It is these many success cases, letters of thank you and even the occasional hug, that have made teaching languages so very worthwhile for me.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.440
And it is this that has persuaded me to publish my courses here for the first time.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.900
I anticipate and hope that they will be as effective for you as they have been for so many of my other students.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.200
Au revoir and good luck.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:22.500
Before we begin, I do need to establish three parameters or three main ground rules for you to follow when you use the course.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.280
The first is that I want you to take time to think out your answers when you're doing the course.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.600
Natural length pauses have been included in the course anyway.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.460
But if you feel you need longer to think out or work out your answer,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.440
simply pause the course and think about it for a moment.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.940
The second ground rule, and perhaps the most important,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.640
is that I don't want you to make an effort to remember the things I'm teaching you.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.340
In fact, strange as it might sound,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.540
it doesn't particularly bother me if you forget something when I first introduce it.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.620
The reason for this is that when people try to memorise things,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.180
perhaps lists of vocabularies or grammar rules or something like that,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.160
they tend not to be able to actually use them when they're speaking the language.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.600
They cram them into their heads,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.000
but they're not necessarily able to use them very easily.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.240
And actually, they still tend to forget them at the crucial moment.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.120
The way that we remember things so that we actually retain them and can use them

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.020
is through usage and through being introduced to something again and again.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.760
For instance, if you follow a sport or a programme on the television,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.220
you'll find you know all about the people who participate in that,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.360
whether it's people who play sports or whether it's actors in a drama.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.820
You'll know all about them,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.000
but you will never have made a conscious effort to actually memorise their names

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.920
or what it is they do on the programme.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.700
Instead, by seeing the same programme again and again,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.260
slowly over time, you'll simply remember it.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.780
And that's what will happen in this course.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.020
I'll introduce certain concepts, certain words,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.300
and you'll hear them and you'll use them

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.100
and then we'll forget about them for a moment

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.260
and I'll let you forget about them.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.440
Later on in the course, I'll bring them up a second time,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.220
by which point you might well not remember them.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.840
But it's this exact action of you being reminded of something

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.400
and then allowed to forget it

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.800
and then reminded again

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.420
and then allowed to forget it

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.800
and then reminded again

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.580
that will eventually allow you to remember

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.700
what I've taught you by itself.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.800
You won't need to try to remember any of it.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.760
You won't need to try to memorise any of it.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.300
All you need to do is take part in the course

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.740
and trust that I will bring it up again later

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.200
and will remind you

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.540
so that by the end of the course,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.180
you remember it automatically

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.440
without ever actually having tried to remember anything.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.580
This is what I do with my students

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.980
and this is what I'll do with you here.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.820
The final ground rule

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.180
is that I don't want you to worry about making mistakes.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.460
When you learn a new language,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.920
you will inevitably make mistakes

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.100
and I think that

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.140
because we get so used to speaking our own languages perfectly,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.200
we find it very hard,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.840
particularly as adults,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.060
to make mistakes when we're speaking out loud.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.300
You'll find, however,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.140
that the beauty of using this method

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.120
is that you will instantly know

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.460
when you've made a mistake

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.820
and you'll also find out why.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.680
This will allow you to change what you're doing

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.600
and to make rapid progress in the language.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.620
And so by making these mistakes

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.400
and knowing how to correct them yourself,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.720
you'll find that you very quickly

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.900
go from a non-speaker of the language

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.560
to being someone who can communicate in it

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.840
with a surprising degree of confidence

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.960
even after just a few hours of studying it.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.140
So again,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.720
to sum up these three ground rules,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.260
firstly,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.960
take your time to work out your answer

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.000
and to think about it.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.340
If you need to pause the course,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.980
you can do that.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.500
It's fine.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.960
Go at your own pace.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.120
Second ground rule is

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.640
don't sit there trying to remember

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.420
what it is I'm teaching on the course.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.680
Just go with the flow of the course.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.440
Take your time to do it,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.800
but don't sit there worrying you've forgotten a word.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.260
I'll actually be expecting you to forget

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.780
some of the things as I teach you

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.340
so that I get a chance to remind you of them later

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.900
and they will come up again

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.520
and you will be reminded of them

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.020
until you remember them.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.000
Without making any effort on your part to do so,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.140
you will simply know those words

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.020
and those rules by the end of the course.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.900
And the final rule,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.960
don't worry about making a mistake.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.980
We learn from mistakes

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.440
and we benefit from them,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.940
particularly when we're learning

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.180
to speak a second language.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.080
So,

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.820
don't worry about any of these things.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.120
Leave your learning of the language

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.900
to me.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.180
And now,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.600
let me introduce Marion.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.240
Bonjour.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.680
Who's come here all the way from Normandy

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.800
to help perfect our French pronunciation?

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.580
Although you may be only vaguely aware of it,

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.960
English and French

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.280
are in fact very closely related languages.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.360
I think we're all aware

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.200
of what happened in 1066,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.620
or at least most of us are.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.040
There was an invasion

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.660
in Britain

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.660
into England

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.620
by the Normans

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.840
and the Normans spoke French

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.000
and they brought French

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.480
to the British Isles.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.040
As a result of that,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.460
it has left a linguistic legacy in English,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.980
which is that five or six

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.880
out of every ten words in English

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.400
have come into English

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.240
through French.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.060
This gives us a big,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.060
big advantage

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.420
when learning French

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.180
if we utilise these words,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:33.660
that is.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.040
I mean,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.420
frequently that's not the case,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.900
but we will be using them here

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.680
because they are one of the biggest advantages

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.380
we have.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.920
As speakers of English,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.980
you'll find that these words

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.860
tend to be the longer ones in English.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.060
The shorter words tend to be

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.540
of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origin.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:51.600
So,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.200
we have this division in English.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.160
Normally,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160
I would say typically,

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.060
words,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.700
seven or eight letters

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.960
in length or longer

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.700
tend to be

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.080
of French Latin origin

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.820
and shorter than that

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.060
tend typically to be

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.740
of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origin.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.120
What it means

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.220
is it's very easy

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.300
to use these longer words

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.700
for it when English speakers

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.700
are speaking French.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.600
Not only this,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.200
but there are also

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.500
more recent French additions

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.700
to the English language

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.620
which still feel French.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.100
For instance,

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.260
you may be familiar

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.400
with terms

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.180
such as

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:29.980
c'est la vie

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.080
which means

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.340
that's life.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.500
You may also

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.460
have heard

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.960
the expression

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.400
as we pronounce it,

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.900
we pronounce it

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.760
déjà vu.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.360
It's a slight

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.160
mispronunciation

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.820
in English,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.960
but we're familiar with it.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:44.940
Literally,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.700
it actually means

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.440
already seen.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.180
So when we say

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.060
we've got déjà vu,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.400
we mean,

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:48.800
oh, you know,

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.640
I feel like I've already

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.400
seen that before.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.640
And there are quite

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.260
a few expressions

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.280
and they're useful too

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.700
and we'll be using them

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.720
where they're relevant

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.340
to learning

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.200
and to speak

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.180
the French language

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.600
competently.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.620
Finally,

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.880
there's another group

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.300
of words

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.160
which are very useful

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.180
for English speakers

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.620
and these words

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.720
are a group of words

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.120
that are still expanding.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.980
They're English words

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.160
that have gone into French

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.820
since the end

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.900
of the Second World War.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.400
And so

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.560
these may well

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.100
be familiar

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.980
to you.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.160
For instance,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.760
you may be familiar

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.260
with

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.640
le weekend.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.580
Yeah.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.280
Le weekend,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.120
which I'm sure

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.500
you can guess

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.140
what that means.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.380
Another one is

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.240
le parking.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.740
Can you guess

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.300
what that means?

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.200
That's car park

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.980
or parking lot

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.400
if you're from

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.040
North America.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.800
Another one is

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.540
le living.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.820
Le living

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.520
actually means

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.160
the living room.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.760
You'll find that

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.520
actually a lot

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.680
of these words

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.260
that have come

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:51.860
into French

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.660
they often have

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.020
bits chopped off

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.160
or it will be

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.000
the same as the English

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.180
but with ing added

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.780
on the end.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.560
For instance,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.280
another example

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:03.860
would be

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.880
if you saw

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.580
the word

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.440
camping

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.280
written in

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.060
in French

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:09.680
so it would

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.200
look like

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.500
the English

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:10.700
word

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.100
camping

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.860
written down.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:12.940
What would

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.220
you think

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:13.760
that meant?

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.220
Would you

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:14.500
think it

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.000
meant camping?

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:17.900
Okay.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:18.880
Actually,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.500
camping,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.160
which correctly

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.840
pronounced in

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.360
French is

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.900
camping.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:22.960
Yes.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.160
So you'll see

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.640
there's a slight

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.000
pronunciation

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.420
different.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:25.820
Actually,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:26.280
it's the

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.340
campsite

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.020
or the

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.200
camping site.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.360
So

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.960
these changes

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.540
in the words

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:32.940
are something

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.640
you get used

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:33.920
to.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.380
But it's

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.080
easier to remember

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.020
something like

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.940
le camping

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.920
then it would

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.540
be a totally

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.340
foreign word.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.080
So these can

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.460
be useful

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.800
and we'll be

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.160
using these

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.620
in the course

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.080
where relevant.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.440
So

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.340
enough about

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.740
the history

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.200
of the French

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.600
language.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.560
Let's get

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.020
started.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.560
I have

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.240
in French

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.960
I have

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.440
is

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:01.940
j'

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.840
j'

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:03.940
j'

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.280
It sounds

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.840
a bit like

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.280
the English

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.000
letter J

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.920
pronounced in

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.320
a French

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.680
way.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:09.520
So again

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.080
j'

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.140
j'

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.220
j'

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.940
j'

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.880
j'

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.340
The word

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.200
for visited

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.880
in French

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.460
visited

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.080
is

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.280
j'

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.720
j'

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:15.780
j'

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.180
j'

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.380
j'

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:17.720

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:19.780
j'

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:19.820
j'

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:19.860
j'

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.280
j'

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.360
j'

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.860
j'

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.360

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.020
j'

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.220
j'

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:00.360
j'

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.160
j'

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.620
j'

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:01.820
j'

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.340
j'

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:02.840
j'

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:02.980
j'

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:09.740
You have in French is

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:18.260
Now again, don't worry at this point about trying to remember what it is we've done already.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.000
The first thing students will often do when I'm teaching them

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.700
is they'll panic and think, oh my goodness, I'm going to forget what it is you're teaching me.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.040
We're already moving on to something new.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.240
But that is exactly what I want.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.800
I want you to forget it because I'm going to remind you of it in a few minutes.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.040
And if you haven't forgot it, it's hard to remind you.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.640
So again, you have is

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.480
Vous avez

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.460
How do you think you'd say you have visited the park?

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.000
Vous avez visité le parc?

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.480
Have you in French, so to turn you have into a question,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.460
you simply, you change round the word order, just like you do in English.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.960
In English, you have you have, which in French is

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.320
Vous avez

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.380
And to ask a question in English, we simply change the you have round and say

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.180
Have you, which in French become

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.300
Avez-vous

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.460
Avez-vous

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.540
So how would you say, have you visited the park?

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.280
Avez-vous visité le parc?

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.020
What about, have you visited the Louvre?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.400
Avez-vous visité le Louvre?

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.220
The word for prepared in French is

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.520
Préparé

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.800
Préparé

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.180
How would you say, I have prepared?

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.640
J'ai préparé

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.040
The coffee in French, the coffee is

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.060
Le café

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.200
Le café

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.580
How would you say, I have prepared the coffee?

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.480
J'ai préparé

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.360
Le café

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.160
Again, don't worry too much about trying to remember all this.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.940
I'll be introducing a lot of concepts earlier on

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.840
in order to give you a chance to forget them

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.520
so that I can remind you of them later

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.620
and as we go through this process of you

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.100
having the words introduced to you

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.060
forgetting them

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.780
and then being reminded of them again

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.880
you'll find that they just start to stick

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.200
without any effort at trying to remember them

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.220
or trying to memorise them

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.400
they will just stick eventually.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.600
Okay, good.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.180
To say for you in French

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.560
for you in French is

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.300
Pour vous

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.080
Pour vous

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.920
So how would you say

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.680
I have prepared the coffee

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.380
for you?

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.540
J'ai préparé

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.420
Le café

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.500
Pour vous

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.480
The roast beef in French

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.920
The roast beef is

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.100
Le rose beef

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.000
Le rose beef

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.740
So it sort of sounds like

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.940
it sounds a bit like the English

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.620
but pronounced in a very French way.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.000
So how would you say

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.460
I have prepared

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.480
the roast beef?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.920
J'ai préparé

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.980
le roast beef

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.540
To say

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.340
for dinner in French

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.300
you will say

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.900
literally

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.780
for

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.380
the

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.900
dinner

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.260
The French will always say

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:34.980
for the dinner

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.000
rather than for dinner

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.660
which in French is

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.480
Pour le

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:38.980
dîner

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.020
Pour le

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.580
dîner

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.860
So how would you say

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.420
I have prepared

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.440
roast beef

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.180
for dinner

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.800
or as the French would say

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.960
I have prepared

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.240
the roast beef

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.460
for the dinner

00:18:53.460 --> 00:19:03.080
J'ai préparé

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.160
le roast beef

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.200
pour le dîner

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.220
J'ai préparé

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.040
le roast beef

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.060
pour le dîner

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.860
Now it's important

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.760
to make sure

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.400
when you're pronouncing

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.580
dinner in French

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.340
to pronounce it as

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.840
Le dîner

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.440
Le dîner

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.140
It sort of has an

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.280
A sound on the end

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.660
because it's such a similar

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.760
word to the English

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.160
students

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.600
people will frequently

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.880
pronounce it

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.720
English speakers

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.680
will pronounce it as

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.440
diner

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.500
or something like that

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.360
but it is

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.120
correctly said as

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.940
Le dîner

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.580
So it's got that

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.760
A sound at the end

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.880
So again

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.620
how would you say

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.460
I have prepared

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.400
the roast beef

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.140
for the dinner

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:54.820
J'ai préparé

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.760
le roast beef

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.560
pour le dîner

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:06.660
How would you say

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.140
you have prepared

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.680
the coffee

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:20.560
Vous avez préparé

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.260
le café

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.100
For me in French

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.580
is

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.580
Pour moi

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.540
Pour moi

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.300
How would you say

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.500
you have prepared

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.220
the coffee

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.000
for me

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.220
Vous avez préparé

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:40.920
le café

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.680
pour moi

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.180
You have in French

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:45.720
is

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.760
Vous avez

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.800
And

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.280
this is a perfectly

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.260
acceptable way

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:51.820
to say

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.720
you have

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.660
in French

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.660
However

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.540
as you may have

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.180
noticed

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.360
it was also

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.300
pronounced as

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.180
Vous avez

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.160
Now the second

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.780
pronunciation

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.420
is the one

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.220
more typically

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.360
used by native

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.280
French speakers

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.700
although both

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.220
are equally

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.920
acceptable

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.140
The basic

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.780
reason why

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.200
there's the

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.340
two options

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.060
for pronunciation

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.380
is that

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.740
in French

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.420
typically

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.500
the consonant

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.040
at the end

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.580
of a word

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.060
won't be

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:20.520
pronounced

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.020
and so

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.440
the word

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:22.800
for you

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.320
in French

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.540
is

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:23.860
vous

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.660
which is

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:25.960
spelt

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.240
v-o-u-s

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.540
and the s

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.080
is not

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.480
normally

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.080
pronounced

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.320
However

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:31.820
for you

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.320
have

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.160
which in

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.440
French

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:33.780
is

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.020
vous avez

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.060
the have

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.740
begins

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.140
with a

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:38.500
vowel

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.180
with a

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.500
and so

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.180
when a word

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.840
follows it

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.320
that begins

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:42.960
with a vowel

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.460
you can

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.280
if you want

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.100
more or less

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.860
push the s

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.520
from the end

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.820
of the word

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.820
onto the vowel

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.660
of the next one

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.840
and so you can

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.200
make

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.800
vous avez

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.200
sound instead

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.620
like

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.340
vous avez

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.060
this is entirely

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.960
optional and up

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.420
to you

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.040
so what I would

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.520
say is

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.400
do what you're

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.000
more comfortable

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.460
with

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.020
but be aware

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.680
at least

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.900
that the French

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.720
may well

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.460
pronounce it

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:07.800
as

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.660
vous avez

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.400
although

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:10.880
although if

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.340
you want

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:11.660
you can

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:11.920
also

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.700
pronounce it

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.080
as

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.840
vous avez

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840
if you find

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.360
it simpler

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.080
to do so

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.560
so

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.980
for me

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.640
in French

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.060
is

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.000
pour moi

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.100
pour moi

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.420
so how would

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:25.860
you say

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.860
you have

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.420

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.460
for me

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.700
now make

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.160
sure

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.900
when you're

saying this

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.600

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.320
all the

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.040
components

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.660

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.640
to do

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.200
is to

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.460
change the

as

a

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.180
let's

00:42:59.180 --> 00:42:59.720
try

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.080
again

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.300
how did

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:01.580
you say

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.100
earlier

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.660
prepared

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.700
and

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:07.860
let's

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.360
try now

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:08.680
to

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.200
prepare

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.860
so

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:13.000
as

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.240
you can

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:13.380
see

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:13.500
it's

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:13.680
the

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.040
same

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.580
now

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.000
they're

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.260
spelt

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:16.740
differently

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.360
but

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:17.480
if

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:17.600
you're

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:17.800
learning

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.000
to

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.260
speak

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:18.540
French

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.040
particularly

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.380
it

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:19.660
doesn't

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:19.980
matter

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:20.380
it

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:20.540
just

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:20.800
makes

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.940
it

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:21.300
easier

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.040
because

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:22.380
you only

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:22.580
ever

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:22.780
need

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:22.940
to

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:23.140
worry

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.440
about

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:23.940
saying

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.820
so

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.660
I would

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.060
like

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.200

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.380
is

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.260
so

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:35.480
how

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:35.660
would

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:35.800
you

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.120

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:35.840
those

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.120
words

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.520
because

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:36.740
the

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.020
consonant

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:37.200
is

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:37.380
not

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:37.520
in

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:37.660
for

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:37.920
luck

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.420
that's

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:38.540
a

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:38.820
general

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.200
rule

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:39.680
and

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:39.880
that's

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.120
something

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:40.340
we'll

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:40.480
get

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:40.740
used

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:40.920
to

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.040
as

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:41.180
we

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:41.320
go

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:41.540
through

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:41.720
the

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.080
course

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:42.520
so

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:42.700
again

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.240
don't

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:43.440
worry

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:43.640
too

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:43.820
much

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:44.040
about

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.400
remembering

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:44.760
it

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.440
and

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.680
I

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:46.800
will

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.080
simply

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.400
bring

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:47.540
it

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:47.660
up

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:47.940
again

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.160
so

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:48.320
it

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:48.520
can

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:48.820
be

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.680
absorbed

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.060
into

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:50.440
something

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:50.660
you

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:50.960
really

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.220
know

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:51.560
by the

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:50.140
word

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.620
and

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:54.820
does

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:54.960
it

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.320
sound

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.040
Germanic

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.320
or

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:56.900
French

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.020
perhaps

00:51:59.020 --> 00:51:59.160
you

00:51:59.160 --> 00:51:59.320
don't

00:51:59.320 --> 00:51:59.460
know

00:51:59.460 --> 00:51:59.560
at

00:51:59.560 --> 00:51:59.720
this

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.140
stage

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:05.020
as

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:05.140
I

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:05.420
mentioned

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:05.700
at the

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.100
beginning

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.200
the

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:07.520
short

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:07.840
words

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:07.980
in

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:08.420
English

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.240
tend

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:09.580
to

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:10.000
be

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:10.620
of

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:11.200
Germanic

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.200
Anglo-Saxon

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.860
origin

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.080
so

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:14.500
a word

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:14.800
like

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.380
room

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:15.780
is

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:16.100
more

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:16.400
likely

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:16.620
than

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:16.860
not

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.060
to

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.200
have

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.540
come

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.080
from

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:18.220
the

Germanic

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:18.860
part

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:18.980
of

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.080
the

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:19.540
language

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.840
so

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:20.960
if

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.040
we

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.240
want

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:21.400
to

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:21.800
find

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.040
what

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.220
the

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:22.480
word

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:22.840
for

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:23.320
room

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:23.480
is

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:23.700
in

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.200
French

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.100
we

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:25.320
can

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:25.620
look

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.040
in

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:26.280
other

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:26.640
areas

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:26.780
of

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.040
English

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:27.240
and

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:27.420
see

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:27.560
if

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:27.780
there's

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:27.900
an

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:28.380
alternative

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:28.820
perhaps

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.040
a

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.320
longer

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:29.840
word

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.540
perhaps

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:30.720
it's

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:30.900
not

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:31.240
used

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:31.420
as

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:31.760
much

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.740
but

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:32.880
we

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.040
can

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:33.240
use

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:33.500
tricks

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:33.780
like

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.060
this

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:34.280
to

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:34.600
find

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.260
vocabulary

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.020
and

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:37.700
as

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:37.880
I've

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.080
often

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:38.340
said

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:38.460
to

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:38.660
people

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.080
before

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:39.420
it's

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:39.660
much

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.020
easier

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:40.200
to

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:40.540
invent

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.180
vocabulary

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:41.620
than

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:41.760
to

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.020
memorize

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:42.420
it

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:42.780
if

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:42.860
you

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:43.020
can

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:43.360
invent

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.500
it

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:43.640
you

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:43.780
can

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.020
invent

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:44.380
thousands

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:44.620
of

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:44.900
words

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.320
if

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:45.420
you

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:45.780
memorize

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:46.220
it

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:46.480
takes

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:46.820
weeks

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:47.040
to

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.220
learn

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:47.340
a

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:47.620
hundred

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.060
now

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:49.340
let's

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:49.620
think

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.080
about

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:50.740
those

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.160
words

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:51.360
we

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:51.620
do

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.000
have

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:52.240
for

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:52.560
room

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:52.700
in

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.200
English

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.180
for

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:54.560
instance

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.140
we

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:55.340
can

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:55.620
say

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.240
bedroom

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:56.440
in

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:56.860
English

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:57.600
but

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:57.820
there's

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.300
also

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:58.620
a

00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:58.820
more

00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.040
old

00:52:59.040 --> 00:52:59.420
fashioned

00:52:59.420 --> 00:52:59.760
way

00:52:59.760 --> 00:52:59.980
to

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.340
refer

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:00.560
to

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:00.740
the

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.200
bedroom

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.020
perhaps

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:02.160
you

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:02.280
can

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:02.440
think

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:02.540
of

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:02.640
an

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.080
example

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.960
if

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.080
you're

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:07.220
not

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:07.420
able

00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:07.580
to

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:07.780
get

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:07.920
it

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.080
by

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:08.500
yourself

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:08.720
I'll

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:08.840
give

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:08.940
you

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:09.140
some

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:09.500
help

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.980
for

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:12.360
instance

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:12.760
perhaps

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.600
even

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:13.980
now

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:14.260
one

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:14.740
talks

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.040
about

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:15.360
something

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:15.640
like

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:15.820
the

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.300
queen's

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:16.660
bed

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.380
chamber

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.260
rather

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:18.420
than

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:18.560
the

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:18.960
queen's

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.500
bedroom

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.820
and

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:20.960
so

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.100
we

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:21.320
also

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:21.540
have

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:21.660
the

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:21.940
word

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:22.660
chamber

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.100
that

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:23.420
means

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:23.640
for

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.060
room

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.960
rather

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.080
than

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.300
simply

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:25.500
using

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:25.740
room

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:25.900
we

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:26.080
use

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:26.180
it

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:26.420
less

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:26.800
often

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.160
but

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:27.260
it

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:27.420
does

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:27.860
exist

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:28.060
in

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:28.500
English

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.600
again

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:29.780
as

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:29.980
I've

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.700
said

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:31.380
typically

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.060
short

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:32.400
words

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:32.600
are

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.060
Germanic

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:33.820
longer

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:34.280
words

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:34.840
are

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.340
French

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.240
I would

Je voudrais

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.600

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.320
The word

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:12.860
for if

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:13.540
in French

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:13.960
is

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.480
Si

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.960
Si

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.340
How would

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.660
you say

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.060
I would

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:18.540

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:18.820
know

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:19.440
if it's

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:19.880
romantic

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.000
So from

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:21.380
the beginning

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:21.960
I would

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.420
like to

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:22.760
know

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:28.980
romantic

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.640
Si c'est

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.340
romantique

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.260
Again

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:36.680
so the

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.480
word for

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.280
if

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:38.840
is

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.620
Si

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.320
and the

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:41.780
word for

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.400
it is

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:42.940
is

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:43.600
Si

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.240
So you

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:45.580
can see

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:46.040
they sound

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:46.440
a bit

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:46.900
similar

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.960
but you'll

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.280
get used

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:48.520
to them

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:48.780
as we

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.220
go on

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:49.640
So again

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:49.940
if

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.260
is

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:50.760
Si

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.420
but it

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:52.680
is

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.500
Si

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.900
The if

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.360
sounds a

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:55.680
bit more

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.100
like the

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.520
sea that

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:56.780
you would

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.240
swim in

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:57.620
a little

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.100
bit like

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.480
that

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.540
but shorter

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.920
and the

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.400
it is

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:01.880
sounds a

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.220
bit more

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:02.600
like the

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:02.820
English

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.120
word

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.600
say

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.280
but it's

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:04.740
not pronounced

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.220
as clearly

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:05.760
as that

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.220
but that's

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:07.660
the difference

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:08.520
one veers

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.240
more towards

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.160
see and

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.480
the other

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:10.920
towards

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.300
say

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.820
but again

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:13.340
there are

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:13.800
no exact

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.280
equivalents

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:14.700
because it's

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.020
a different

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:15.500
language

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.200
so again

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:17.500
one more

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:17.820
time

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.120
if

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:18.460
is

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.040
Si

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.080
and it

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:20.320
is

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:20.660
is

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.100
Si

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.340
Let's move

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:23.820
on to another

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:24.500
word now

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.520
the word for

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.500
but in French

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:26.900
is

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.560
Mais

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.460
Mais

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.300
So how

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:31.660
would you

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.080
say

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.760
I would

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.700
like a room

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:39.700
romantic

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.780
We'll start

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.000
at the

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.300
beginning

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:42.740
so that you

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.260

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:43.620
