Welcome to Learn French with Paul Noble. Content copyright Paul Noble 2010.

00:12.920 --> 00:19.100
I'm Paul Noble. Over the years I have taught many, many people.

00:20.680 --> 00:27.420
Curiously, they have each had much the same story to tell regarding their previous experiences of language learning.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.940
As a result, these days, when I first start a teaching session, I ask my students to raise their hands if they have had any of the following experiences.

00:41.200 --> 00:49.060
Raise your hand, I say, if you studied a language for several years at school but came out unable to really say anything.

00:50.500 --> 00:57.100
Or, if you have ever bought a language course and given up around page 30, somewhere around chapter 2.

00:57.100 --> 01:04.460
Or, if you have ever felt more confused by a teacher's explanation of the language than by the language itself.

01:06.960 --> 01:12.220
Perhaps you've been amazed by just how closely grammar books resemble furniture assembly instructions.

01:12.220 --> 01:19.060
Or, you may have felt that you are in fact more or less incapable of learning a foreign language.

01:21.040 --> 01:26.100
Invariably, when asked these questions, all the students soon have at least one hand in the air.

01:26.700 --> 01:27.440
And they laugh.

01:28.720 --> 01:33.860
They laugh because for some reason, our language learning experiences tend to be very similar.

01:34.860 --> 01:38.800
And sadly, these similar experiences tend not to be very good ones.

01:38.800 --> 01:47.500
My own initial experiences of language learning were also uncannily similar to those I've just described.

01:48.660 --> 01:53.760
In fact, when I ask my students these questions, my own hand is the first to go up.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.040
And it stays up until we have gone through them all.

01:57.040 --> 02:07.220
However, these less than positive experiences have had an upside both for myself and for those individuals I have taught.

02:08.040 --> 02:16.340
Because these experiences, along with a number of other factors, have helped inform and shape the method that will be used during this course.

02:17.880 --> 02:25.020
Using this method, you will learn how to communicate in French and how to formulate your own ideas and thoughts using French.

02:25.020 --> 02:33.300
As you learn with it, you will quickly discover that I do not use complicated grammatical explanations at all.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.000
And I will not ask you to memorise long lists of vocabulary.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.760
The way the course is structured will by itself ensure that you remember what you are taught.

02:42.760 --> 02:54.680
Instead, through your interaction with the CDs, I will lead you through the French language, enabling you to build up complex sentences by yourself, step by step.

02:55.340 --> 02:59.960
So that you are actually speaking independently in French by the end of the course.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.160
And this is regardless of how little or how much you know when you begin.

03:05.160 --> 03:10.720
You will also discover that the language I teach is designed to be adaptable.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.580
So you will be able to use it just as easily for holidaying in a French-speaking country as for living or working in one.

03:18.840 --> 03:24.480
It will be just as easy to use it to order a coffee as to hold a conversation with the waiter who brings it to you.

03:25.540 --> 03:30.440
And again, all of this regardless of how little or how much you know when you begin.

03:30.440 --> 03:40.580
This method has already proved extremely successful with a very great many students, including hundreds of so-called no-hopers.

03:42.140 --> 03:45.840
Interestingly, not one of these students failed to learn using this method.

03:47.300 --> 03:55.520
It is these many success cases, letters of thank you and even the occasional hug, that have made teaching languages so very worthwhile for me.

03:55.520 --> 04:00.440
And it is this that has persuaded me to publish my courses here for the first time.

04:02.160 --> 04:07.900
I anticipate and hope that they will be as effective for you as they have been for so many of my other students.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.200
Au revoir and good luck.

04:12.700 --> 04:22.500
Before we begin, I do need to establish three parameters or three main ground rules for you to follow when you use the course.

04:22.500 --> 04:30.280
The first is that I want you to take time to think out your answers when you're doing the course.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.600
Natural length pauses have been included in the course anyway.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.460
But if you feel you need longer to think out or work out your answer,

04:43.540 --> 04:46.440
simply pause the course and think about it for a moment.

04:46.440 --> 04:52.940
The second ground rule, and perhaps the most important,

04:53.940 --> 04:58.640
is that I don't want you to make an effort to remember the things I'm teaching you.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.340
In fact, strange as it might sound,

05:04.040 --> 05:08.540
it doesn't particularly bother me if you forget something when I first introduce it.

05:08.540 --> 05:15.620
The reason for this is that when people try to memorise things,

05:15.880 --> 05:20.180
perhaps lists of vocabularies or grammar rules or something like that,

05:21.060 --> 05:26.160
they tend not to be able to actually use them when they're speaking the language.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.600
They cram them into their heads,

05:29.120 --> 05:32.000
but they're not necessarily able to use them very easily.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.240
And actually, they still tend to forget them at the crucial moment.

05:39.620 --> 05:44.120
The way that we remember things so that we actually retain them and can use them

05:44.120 --> 05:49.020
is through usage and through being introduced to something again and again.

05:49.820 --> 05:53.760
For instance, if you follow a sport or a programme on the television,

05:54.640 --> 05:58.220
you'll find you know all about the people who participate in that,

05:58.220 --> 06:03.360
whether it's people who play sports or whether it's actors in a drama.

06:03.700 --> 06:04.820
You'll know all about them,

06:05.240 --> 06:09.000
but you will never have made a conscious effort to actually memorise their names

06:09.000 --> 06:10.920
or what it is they do on the programme.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.700
Instead, by seeing the same programme again and again,

06:17.120 --> 06:19.260
slowly over time, you'll simply remember it.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.780
And that's what will happen in this course.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.020
I'll introduce certain concepts, certain words,

06:26.020 --> 06:28.300
and you'll hear them and you'll use them

06:28.300 --> 06:32.100
and then we'll forget about them for a moment

06:32.100 --> 06:34.260
and I'll let you forget about them.

06:35.620 --> 06:38.440
Later on in the course, I'll bring them up a second time,

06:38.620 --> 06:41.220
by which point you might well not remember them.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.840
But it's this exact action of you being reminded of something

06:46.840 --> 06:48.400
and then allowed to forget it

06:48.400 --> 06:49.800
and then reminded again

06:49.800 --> 06:51.420
and then allowed to forget it

06:51.420 --> 06:52.800
and then reminded again

06:52.800 --> 06:55.580
that will eventually allow you to remember

06:55.580 --> 06:58.700
what I've taught you by itself.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.800
You won't need to try to remember any of it.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.760
You won't need to try to memorise any of it.

07:03.180 --> 07:05.300
All you need to do is take part in the course

07:05.300 --> 07:08.740
and trust that I will bring it up again later

07:08.740 --> 07:10.200
and will remind you

07:10.200 --> 07:11.540
so that by the end of the course,

07:11.980 --> 07:13.180
you remember it automatically

07:13.180 --> 07:16.440
without ever actually having tried to remember anything.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.580
This is what I do with my students

07:18.580 --> 07:20.980
and this is what I'll do with you here.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.820
The final ground rule

07:24.820 --> 07:28.180
is that I don't want you to worry about making mistakes.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.460
When you learn a new language,

07:31.700 --> 07:33.920
you will inevitably make mistakes

07:33.920 --> 07:36.100
and I think that

07:36.100 --> 07:39.140
because we get so used to speaking our own languages perfectly,

07:39.360 --> 07:41.200
we find it very hard,

07:41.800 --> 07:42.840
particularly as adults,

07:43.220 --> 07:46.060
to make mistakes when we're speaking out loud.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.300
You'll find, however,

07:48.500 --> 07:50.140
that the beauty of using this method

07:50.140 --> 07:52.120
is that you will instantly know

07:52.120 --> 07:53.460
when you've made a mistake

07:53.460 --> 07:55.820
and you'll also find out why.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.680
This will allow you to change what you're doing

07:59.680 --> 08:02.600
and to make rapid progress in the language.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.620
And so by making these mistakes

08:05.620 --> 08:08.400
and knowing how to correct them yourself,

08:09.080 --> 08:10.720
you'll find that you very quickly

08:10.720 --> 08:12.900
go from a non-speaker of the language

08:12.900 --> 08:15.560
to being someone who can communicate in it

08:15.560 --> 08:17.840
with a surprising degree of confidence

08:17.840 --> 08:20.960
even after just a few hours of studying it.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.140
So again,

08:23.740 --> 08:25.720
to sum up these three ground rules,

08:26.660 --> 08:27.260
firstly,

08:27.960 --> 08:29.960
take your time to work out your answer

08:29.960 --> 08:31.000
and to think about it.

08:31.180 --> 08:32.340
If you need to pause the course,

08:32.440 --> 08:32.980
you can do that.

08:33.020 --> 08:33.500
It's fine.

08:33.900 --> 08:34.960
Go at your own pace.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.120
Second ground rule is

08:38.120 --> 08:40.640
don't sit there trying to remember

08:40.640 --> 08:42.420
what it is I'm teaching on the course.

08:42.420 --> 08:44.680
Just go with the flow of the course.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.440
Take your time to do it,

08:46.640 --> 08:48.800
but don't sit there worrying you've forgotten a word.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.260
I'll actually be expecting you to forget

08:51.260 --> 08:52.780
some of the things as I teach you

08:52.780 --> 08:55.340
so that I get a chance to remind you of them later

08:55.340 --> 08:56.900
and they will come up again

08:56.900 --> 08:58.520
and you will be reminded of them

08:58.520 --> 09:00.020
until you remember them.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.000
Without making any effort on your part to do so,

09:03.340 --> 09:05.140
you will simply know those words

09:05.140 --> 09:08.020
and those rules by the end of the course.

09:08.020 --> 09:10.900
And the final rule,

09:11.320 --> 09:12.960
don't worry about making a mistake.

09:13.740 --> 09:14.980
We learn from mistakes

09:14.980 --> 09:16.440
and we benefit from them,

09:16.860 --> 09:17.940
particularly when we're learning

09:17.940 --> 09:20.180
to speak a second language.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.080
So,

09:22.300 --> 09:24.820
don't worry about any of these things.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.120
Leave your learning of the language

09:27.120 --> 09:27.900
to me.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.180
And now,

09:30.400 --> 09:31.600
let me introduce Marion.

09:31.960 --> 09:32.240
Bonjour.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.680
Who's come here all the way from Normandy

09:34.680 --> 09:36.800
to help perfect our French pronunciation?

09:45.980 --> 09:48.580
Although you may be only vaguely aware of it,

09:49.100 --> 09:49.960
English and French

09:49.960 --> 09:52.280
are in fact very closely related languages.

09:53.180 --> 09:54.360
I think we're all aware

09:54.360 --> 09:56.200
of what happened in 1066,

09:56.500 --> 09:57.620
or at least most of us are.

09:57.620 --> 10:00.040
There was an invasion

10:00.040 --> 10:01.660
in Britain

10:01.660 --> 10:02.660
into England

10:02.660 --> 10:04.620
by the Normans

10:04.620 --> 10:07.840
and the Normans spoke French

10:07.840 --> 10:10.000
and they brought French

10:10.000 --> 10:11.480
to the British Isles.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.040
As a result of that,

10:15.120 --> 10:18.460
it has left a linguistic legacy in English,

10:18.780 --> 10:20.980
which is that five or six

10:20.980 --> 10:22.880
out of every ten words in English

10:22.880 --> 10:24.400
have come into English

10:24.400 --> 10:25.240
through French.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.060
This gives us a big,

10:28.100 --> 10:29.060
big advantage

10:29.060 --> 10:30.420
when learning French

10:30.420 --> 10:33.180
if we utilise these words,

10:33.280 --> 10:33.660
that is.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.040
I mean,

10:34.140 --> 10:35.420
frequently that's not the case,

10:35.520 --> 10:36.900
but we will be using them here

10:36.900 --> 10:38.680
because they are one of the biggest advantages

10:38.680 --> 10:39.380
we have.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.920
As speakers of English,

10:42.540 --> 10:43.980
you'll find that these words

10:43.980 --> 10:45.860
tend to be the longer ones in English.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.060
The shorter words tend to be

10:48.060 --> 10:50.540
of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origin.

10:51.340 --> 10:51.600
So,

10:51.720 --> 10:53.200
we have this division in English.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.160
Normally,

10:54.160 --> 10:55.160
I would say typically,

10:55.940 --> 10:57.060
words,

10:57.380 --> 10:58.700
seven or eight letters

10:58.700 --> 10:59.960
in length or longer

10:59.960 --> 11:00.700
tend to be

11:00.700 --> 11:02.080
of French Latin origin

11:02.080 --> 11:03.820
and shorter than that

11:03.820 --> 11:05.060
tend typically to be

11:05.060 --> 11:06.740
of Germanic Anglo-Saxon origin.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.120
What it means

11:08.120 --> 11:09.220
is it's very easy

11:09.220 --> 11:11.300
to use these longer words

11:11.300 --> 11:12.700
for it when English speakers

11:12.700 --> 11:13.700
are speaking French.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.600
Not only this,

11:15.980 --> 11:17.200
but there are also

11:17.200 --> 11:18.500
more recent French additions

11:18.500 --> 11:19.700
to the English language

11:19.700 --> 11:21.620
which still feel French.

11:21.620 --> 11:24.100
For instance,

11:24.980 --> 11:26.260
you may be familiar

11:26.260 --> 11:27.400
with terms

11:27.400 --> 11:29.180
such as

11:29.180 --> 11:29.980
c'est la vie

11:29.980 --> 11:31.080
which means

11:31.080 --> 11:32.340
that's life.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.500
You may also

11:34.500 --> 11:35.460
have heard

11:35.460 --> 11:36.960
the expression

11:36.960 --> 11:38.400
as we pronounce it,

11:38.400 --> 11:38.900
we pronounce it

11:38.900 --> 11:39.760
déjà vu.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.360
It's a slight

11:41.360 --> 11:42.160
mispronunciation

11:42.160 --> 11:42.820
in English,

11:42.960 --> 11:43.960
but we're familiar with it.

11:44.500 --> 11:44.940
Literally,

11:45.120 --> 11:45.700
it actually means

11:45.700 --> 11:46.440
already seen.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.180
So when we say

11:47.180 --> 11:48.060
we've got déjà vu,

11:48.180 --> 11:48.400
we mean,

11:48.460 --> 11:48.800
oh, you know,

11:48.820 --> 11:49.640
I feel like I've already

11:49.640 --> 11:50.400
seen that before.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.640
And there are quite

11:51.640 --> 11:52.260
a few expressions

11:52.260 --> 11:53.280
and they're useful too

11:53.280 --> 11:54.700
and we'll be using them

11:54.700 --> 11:55.720
where they're relevant

11:55.720 --> 11:56.340
to learning

11:56.340 --> 11:57.200
and to speak

11:57.200 --> 11:58.180
the French language

11:58.180 --> 11:59.600
competently.

12:01.180 --> 12:01.620
Finally,

12:02.100 --> 12:02.880
there's another group

12:02.880 --> 12:03.300
of words

12:03.300 --> 12:04.160
which are very useful

12:04.160 --> 12:05.180
for English speakers

12:05.180 --> 12:07.620
and these words

12:07.620 --> 12:08.720
are a group of words

12:08.720 --> 12:10.120
that are still expanding.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.980
They're English words

12:12.980 --> 12:14.160
that have gone into French

12:14.160 --> 12:14.820
since the end

12:14.820 --> 12:15.900
of the Second World War.

12:16.440 --> 12:17.400
And so

12:17.400 --> 12:19.560
these may well

12:19.560 --> 12:20.100
be familiar

12:20.100 --> 12:20.980
to you.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.160
For instance,

12:23.800 --> 12:24.760
you may be familiar

12:24.760 --> 12:25.260
with

12:25.260 --> 12:26.640
le weekend.

12:27.300 --> 12:27.580
Yeah.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.280
Le weekend,

12:29.600 --> 12:30.120
which I'm sure

12:30.120 --> 12:30.500
you can guess

12:30.500 --> 12:31.140
what that means.

12:31.660 --> 12:32.380
Another one is

12:32.380 --> 12:33.240
le parking.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.740
Can you guess

12:34.740 --> 12:35.300
what that means?

12:36.820 --> 12:38.200
That's car park

12:38.200 --> 12:39.980
or parking lot

12:39.980 --> 12:40.400
if you're from

12:40.400 --> 12:41.040
North America.

12:41.740 --> 12:42.800
Another one is

12:42.800 --> 12:43.540
le living.

12:43.540 --> 12:45.820
Le living

12:45.820 --> 12:46.520
actually means

12:46.520 --> 12:47.160
the living room.

12:48.160 --> 12:48.760
You'll find that

12:48.760 --> 12:49.520
actually a lot

12:49.520 --> 12:50.680
of these words

12:50.680 --> 12:51.260
that have come

12:51.260 --> 12:51.860
into French

12:51.860 --> 12:52.660
they often have

12:52.660 --> 12:54.020
bits chopped off

12:54.020 --> 12:56.160
or it will be

12:56.160 --> 12:57.000
the same as the English

12:57.000 --> 12:58.180
but with ing added

12:58.180 --> 12:58.780
on the end.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.560
For instance,

13:02.660 --> 13:03.280
another example

13:03.280 --> 13:03.860
would be

13:03.860 --> 13:04.880
if you saw

13:04.880 --> 13:05.580
the word

13:05.580 --> 13:06.440
camping

13:06.440 --> 13:08.280
written in

13:08.280 --> 13:09.060
in French

13:09.060 --> 13:09.680
so it would

13:09.680 --> 13:10.200
look like

13:10.200 --> 13:10.500
the English

13:10.500 --> 13:10.700
word

13:10.700 --> 13:11.100
camping

13:11.100 --> 13:11.860
written down.

13:12.640 --> 13:12.940
What would

13:12.940 --> 13:13.220
you think

13:13.220 --> 13:13.760
that meant?

13:14.040 --> 13:14.220
Would you

13:14.220 --> 13:14.500
think it

13:14.500 --> 13:15.000
meant camping?

13:17.560 --> 13:17.900
Okay.

13:18.440 --> 13:18.880
Actually,

13:19.180 --> 13:19.500
camping,

13:19.660 --> 13:20.160
which correctly

13:20.160 --> 13:20.840
pronounced in

13:20.840 --> 13:21.360
French is

13:21.360 --> 13:21.900
camping.

13:22.520 --> 13:22.960
Yes.

13:23.640 --> 13:24.160
So you'll see

13:24.160 --> 13:24.640
there's a slight

13:24.640 --> 13:25.000
pronunciation

13:25.000 --> 13:25.420
different.

13:25.560 --> 13:25.820
Actually,

13:25.940 --> 13:26.280
it's the

13:26.280 --> 13:27.340
campsite

13:27.340 --> 13:28.020
or the

13:28.020 --> 13:29.200
camping site.

13:30.160 --> 13:30.360
So

13:30.360 --> 13:31.960
these changes

13:31.960 --> 13:32.540
in the words

13:32.540 --> 13:32.940
are something

13:32.940 --> 13:33.640
you get used

13:33.640 --> 13:33.920
to.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.380
But it's

13:35.380 --> 13:36.080
easier to remember

13:36.080 --> 13:37.020
something like

13:37.020 --> 13:37.940
le camping

13:37.940 --> 13:40.920
then it would

13:40.920 --> 13:41.540
be a totally

13:41.540 --> 13:42.340
foreign word.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.080
So these can

13:43.080 --> 13:43.460
be useful

13:43.460 --> 13:43.800
and we'll be

13:43.800 --> 13:44.160
using these

13:44.160 --> 13:44.620
in the course

13:44.620 --> 13:45.080
where relevant.

13:52.960 --> 13:53.440
So

13:53.440 --> 13:54.340
enough about

13:54.340 --> 13:54.740
the history

13:54.740 --> 13:55.200
of the French

13:55.200 --> 13:55.600
language.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.560
Let's get

13:56.560 --> 13:57.020
started.

13:58.540 --> 13:59.560
I have

13:59.560 --> 14:00.240
in French

14:00.240 --> 14:00.960
I have

14:00.960 --> 14:01.440
is

14:01.440 --> 14:01.940
j'

14:01.940 --> 14:03.840
j'

14:03.840 --> 14:03.940
j'

14:03.940 --> 14:05.280
It sounds

14:05.280 --> 14:05.840
a bit like

14:05.840 --> 14:06.280
the English

14:06.280 --> 14:07.000
letter J

14:07.000 --> 14:07.920
pronounced in

14:07.920 --> 14:08.320
a French

14:08.320 --> 14:08.680
way.

14:09.140 --> 14:09.520
So again

14:09.520 --> 14:10.080
j'

14:10.080 --> 14:10.140
j'

14:10.140 --> 14:10.220
j'

14:10.220 --> 14:10.940
j'

14:10.940 --> 14:11.880
j'

14:11.880 --> 14:12.340
The word

14:12.340 --> 14:13.200
for visited

14:13.200 --> 14:13.880
in French

14:13.880 --> 14:14.460
visited

14:14.460 --> 14:15.080
is

14:15.080 --> 14:15.280
j'

14:15.280 --> 14:15.720
j'

14:15.720 --> 14:15.780
j'

14:15.780 --> 14:16.180
j'

14:16.180 --> 14:17.380
j'

14:17.380 --> 14:17.720
j'

14:17.720 --> 14:19.680
j'

14:19.680 --> 14:19.720
j'

14:19.720 --> 14:19.780
j'

14:19.780 --> 14:19.820
j'

14:19.820 --> 14:19.860
j'

14:19.860 --> 14:20.280
j'

14:20.280 --> 14:20.360
j'

14:20.360 --> 14:20.860
j'

14:20.860 --> 14:21.360
j'

14:21.360 --> 14:21.820
j'

14:21.820 --> 14:21.860
j'

14:21.860 --> 14:22.860
j'

14:22.860 --> 14:23.360
j'

14:23.360 --> 14:23.820
j'

14:23.820 --> 14:24.320
j'

14:24.320 --> 14:25.220
j'

14:25.220 --> 14:25.820
j'

14:25.820 --> 14:27.320
j'

14:27.320 --> 14:29.240
j'

14:29.240 --> 14:29.260
j'

14:29.260 --> 14:29.300
j'

14:29.300 --> 14:29.340
j'

14:29.340 --> 14:29.360
j'

14:29.360 --> 14:29.400
j'

14:29.400 --> 14:29.860
j'

14:29.860 --> 14:29.940
j'

14:29.940 --> 14:30.940
j'

14:30.940 --> 14:31.940
j'

14:31.940 --> 14:32.940
j'

14:32.940 --> 14:32.960
j'

14:32.960 --> 14:33.000
j'

14:33.000 --> 14:34.140
j'

14:34.140 --> 14:34.660
j'

14:34.660 --> 14:35.540
j'

14:35.540 --> 14:35.860
j'

14:35.860 --> 14:36.100
j'

14:36.100 --> 14:36.700
j'

14:36.700 --> 14:37.000
j'

14:37.560 --> 14:38.300
j'

14:38.300 --> 14:38.340
j'

14:38.340 --> 14:40.840
j'

14:41.240 --> 14:41.380
j'

14:41.380 --> 14:41.620
j'

14:41.620 --> 14:44.300
j'

14:44.300 --> 14:46.420
j'

14:46.420 --> 14:46.440
j'

14:46.440 --> 14:49.240
j'

14:49.500 --> 14:50.960
j'

14:50.960 --> 14:52.240
j'

14:52.440 --> 14:52.860
j'

14:52.860 --> 14:53.960
j'

14:53.960 --> 14:54.420
j'

14:54.420 --> 14:54.820
j'

14:54.820 --> 14:55.080
j'

14:55.080 --> 14:56.020
j'

14:56.020 --> 14:56.220
j'

14:56.220 --> 14:56.540
j'

14:56.540 --> 14:57.120
j'

14:57.120 --> 14:58.340
j'

14:58.520 --> 14:59.060
j'

14:59.060 --> 14:59.420
j'

14:59.420 --> 15:00.020
j'

15:00.020 --> 15:00.220
j'

15:00.220 --> 15:00.360
j'

15:00.360 --> 15:01.160
j'

15:01.160 --> 15:01.620
j'

15:01.760 --> 15:01.820
j'

15:01.820 --> 15:02.340
j'

15:02.340 --> 15:02.840
j'

15:02.840 --> 15:02.980
j'

15:02.980 --> 15:09.740
You have in French is

15:09.740 --> 15:18.260
Now again, don't worry at this point about trying to remember what it is we've done already.

15:18.860 --> 15:22.000
The first thing students will often do when I'm teaching them

15:22.000 --> 15:26.700
is they'll panic and think, oh my goodness, I'm going to forget what it is you're teaching me.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.040
We're already moving on to something new.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.240
But that is exactly what I want.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.800
I want you to forget it because I'm going to remind you of it in a few minutes.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.040
And if you haven't forgot it, it's hard to remind you.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.640
So again, you have is

15:39.640 --> 15:40.480
Vous avez

15:40.480 --> 15:44.460
How do you think you'd say you have visited the park?

15:48.600 --> 15:51.000
Vous avez visité le parc?

15:54.020 --> 15:57.480
Have you in French, so to turn you have into a question,

15:57.480 --> 16:01.460
you simply, you change round the word order, just like you do in English.

16:01.580 --> 16:04.960
In English, you have you have, which in French is

16:04.960 --> 16:06.320
Vous avez

16:06.320 --> 16:10.380
And to ask a question in English, we simply change the you have round and say

16:10.380 --> 16:13.180
Have you, which in French become

16:13.180 --> 16:14.300
Avez-vous

16:14.300 --> 16:16.460
Avez-vous

16:16.460 --> 16:19.540
So how would you say, have you visited the park?

16:23.540 --> 16:25.280
Avez-vous visité le parc?

16:26.160 --> 16:29.020
What about, have you visited the Louvre?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.400
Avez-vous visité le Louvre?

16:35.400 --> 16:40.220
The word for prepared in French is

16:40.220 --> 16:41.520
Préparé

16:41.520 --> 16:43.800
Préparé

16:43.800 --> 16:47.180
How would you say, I have prepared?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.640
J'ai préparé

16:54.640 --> 16:59.040
The coffee in French, the coffee is

16:59.040 --> 17:00.060
Le café

17:00.060 --> 17:02.200
Le café

17:02.200 --> 17:05.580
How would you say, I have prepared the coffee?

17:09.360 --> 17:10.480
J'ai préparé

17:10.480 --> 17:11.360
Le café

17:11.360 --> 17:15.160
Again, don't worry too much about trying to remember all this.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.940
I'll be introducing a lot of concepts earlier on

17:17.940 --> 17:19.840
in order to give you a chance to forget them

17:19.840 --> 17:21.520
so that I can remind you of them later

17:21.520 --> 17:23.620
and as we go through this process of you

17:23.620 --> 17:26.100
having the words introduced to you

17:26.100 --> 17:27.060
forgetting them

17:27.060 --> 17:28.780
and then being reminded of them again

17:28.780 --> 17:30.880
you'll find that they just start to stick

17:30.880 --> 17:33.200
without any effort at trying to remember them

17:33.200 --> 17:34.220
or trying to memorise them

17:34.220 --> 17:35.400
they will just stick eventually.

17:36.540 --> 17:37.600
Okay, good.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.180
To say for you in French

17:43.180 --> 17:44.560
for you in French is

17:44.560 --> 17:45.300
Pour vous

17:45.300 --> 17:47.080
Pour vous

17:47.080 --> 17:49.920
So how would you say

17:49.920 --> 17:51.680
I have prepared the coffee

17:51.680 --> 17:52.380
for you?

17:57.180 --> 17:58.540
J'ai préparé

17:58.540 --> 17:59.420
Le café

17:59.420 --> 18:00.500
Pour vous

18:00.500 --> 18:04.480
The roast beef in French

18:04.480 --> 18:05.920
The roast beef is

18:05.920 --> 18:07.100
Le rose beef

18:07.100 --> 18:09.000
Le rose beef

18:09.000 --> 18:10.740
So it sort of sounds like

18:10.740 --> 18:11.940
it sounds a bit like the English

18:11.940 --> 18:13.620
but pronounced in a very French way.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.000
So how would you say

18:16.000 --> 18:17.460
I have prepared

18:17.460 --> 18:18.480
the roast beef?

18:19.920 --> 18:23.920
J'ai préparé

18:23.920 --> 18:24.980
le roast beef

18:24.980 --> 18:27.540
To say

18:27.540 --> 18:29.340
for dinner in French

18:29.340 --> 18:30.300
you will say

18:30.300 --> 18:30.900
literally

18:30.900 --> 18:31.780
for

18:31.780 --> 18:32.380
the

18:32.380 --> 18:32.900
dinner

18:32.900 --> 18:34.260
The French will always say

18:34.260 --> 18:34.980
for the dinner

18:34.980 --> 18:36.000
rather than for dinner

18:36.000 --> 18:37.660
which in French is

18:37.660 --> 18:38.480
Pour le

18:38.480 --> 18:38.980
dîner

18:38.980 --> 18:41.020
Pour le

18:41.020 --> 18:41.580
dîner

18:41.580 --> 18:44.860
So how would you say

18:44.860 --> 18:46.420
I have prepared

18:46.420 --> 18:47.440
roast beef

18:47.440 --> 18:48.180
for dinner

18:48.180 --> 18:49.800
or as the French would say

18:49.800 --> 18:50.960
I have prepared

18:50.960 --> 18:52.240
the roast beef

18:52.240 --> 18:53.460
for the dinner

18:53.460 --> 19:03.080
J'ai préparé

19:03.080 --> 19:04.160
le roast beef

19:04.160 --> 19:05.200
pour le dîner

19:05.200 --> 19:08.220
J'ai préparé

19:08.220 --> 19:09.040
le roast beef

19:09.040 --> 19:10.060
pour le dîner

19:10.060 --> 19:11.860
Now it's important

19:11.860 --> 19:12.760
to make sure

19:12.760 --> 19:14.400
when you're pronouncing

19:14.400 --> 19:15.580
dinner in French

19:15.580 --> 19:17.340
to pronounce it as

19:17.340 --> 19:18.840
Le dîner

19:18.840 --> 19:21.440
Le dîner

19:21.440 --> 19:23.140
It sort of has an

19:23.140 --> 19:24.280
A sound on the end

19:24.280 --> 19:25.660
because it's such a similar

19:25.660 --> 19:26.760
word to the English

19:26.760 --> 19:28.160
students

19:28.160 --> 19:29.600
people will frequently

19:29.600 --> 19:30.880
pronounce it

19:30.880 --> 19:31.720
English speakers

19:31.720 --> 19:32.680
will pronounce it as

19:32.680 --> 19:33.440
diner

19:33.440 --> 19:34.500
or something like that

19:34.500 --> 19:35.360
but it is

19:35.360 --> 19:37.120
correctly said as

19:37.120 --> 19:37.940
Le dîner

19:37.940 --> 19:39.580
So it's got that

19:39.580 --> 19:40.760
A sound at the end

19:40.760 --> 19:44.880
So again

19:44.880 --> 19:45.620
how would you say

19:45.620 --> 19:46.460
I have prepared

19:46.460 --> 19:47.400
the roast beef

19:47.400 --> 19:48.140
for the dinner

19:48.140 --> 19:54.820
J'ai préparé

19:54.820 --> 19:55.760
le roast beef

19:55.760 --> 19:56.560
pour le dîner

19:56.560 --> 20:06.660
How would you say

20:06.660 --> 20:08.140
you have prepared

20:08.140 --> 20:08.680
the coffee

20:08.680 --> 20:20.560
Vous avez préparé

20:20.560 --> 20:21.260
le café

20:21.260 --> 20:25.100
For me in French

20:25.100 --> 20:25.580
is

20:25.580 --> 20:26.580
Pour moi

20:26.580 --> 20:28.540
Pour moi

20:28.540 --> 20:30.300
How would you say

20:30.300 --> 20:31.500
you have prepared

20:31.500 --> 20:32.220
the coffee

20:32.220 --> 20:33.000
for me

20:33.000 --> 20:40.220
Vous avez préparé

20:40.220 --> 20:40.920
le café

20:40.920 --> 20:41.680
pour moi

20:41.680 --> 20:45.180
You have in French

20:45.180 --> 20:45.720
is

20:45.720 --> 20:46.760
Vous avez

20:46.760 --> 20:48.800
And

20:48.800 --> 20:50.280
this is a perfectly

20:50.280 --> 20:51.260
acceptable way

20:51.260 --> 20:51.820
to say

20:51.820 --> 20:52.720
you have

20:52.720 --> 20:53.660
in French

20:53.660 --> 20:54.660
However

20:54.660 --> 20:55.540
as you may have

20:55.540 --> 20:56.180
noticed

20:56.180 --> 20:57.360
it was also

20:57.360 --> 20:58.300
pronounced as

20:58.300 --> 20:59.180
Vous avez

20:59.180 --> 21:01.160
Now the second

21:01.160 --> 21:01.780
pronunciation

21:01.780 --> 21:03.420
is the one

21:03.420 --> 21:04.220
more typically

21:04.220 --> 21:05.360
used by native

21:05.360 --> 21:06.280
French speakers

21:06.280 --> 21:07.700
although both

21:07.700 --> 21:08.220
are equally

21:08.220 --> 21:08.920
acceptable

21:08.920 --> 21:11.140
The basic

21:11.140 --> 21:11.780
reason why

21:11.780 --> 21:12.200
there's the

21:12.200 --> 21:13.340
two options

21:13.340 --> 21:14.060
for pronunciation

21:14.060 --> 21:15.380
is that

21:15.380 --> 21:16.740
in French

21:16.740 --> 21:17.420
typically

21:17.420 --> 21:18.500
the consonant

21:18.500 --> 21:19.040
at the end

21:19.040 --> 21:19.580
of a word

21:19.580 --> 21:20.060
won't be

21:20.060 --> 21:20.520
pronounced

21:20.520 --> 21:22.020
and so

21:22.020 --> 21:22.440
the word

21:22.440 --> 21:22.800
for you

21:22.800 --> 21:23.320
in French

21:23.320 --> 21:23.540
is

21:23.540 --> 21:23.860
vous

21:23.860 --> 21:25.660
which is

21:25.660 --> 21:25.960
spelt

21:25.960 --> 21:27.240
v-o-u-s

21:27.240 --> 21:28.540
and the s

21:28.540 --> 21:29.080
is not

21:29.080 --> 21:29.480
normally

21:29.480 --> 21:30.080
pronounced

21:30.080 --> 21:31.320
However

21:31.320 --> 21:31.820
for you

21:31.820 --> 21:32.320
have

21:32.320 --> 21:33.160
which in

21:33.160 --> 21:33.440
French

21:33.440 --> 21:33.780
is

21:33.780 --> 21:35.020
vous avez

21:35.020 --> 21:37.060
the have

21:37.060 --> 21:37.740
begins

21:37.740 --> 21:38.140
with a

21:38.140 --> 21:38.500
vowel

21:38.500 --> 21:39.180
with a

21:39.180 --> 21:40.500
and so

21:40.500 --> 21:41.180
when a word

21:41.180 --> 21:41.840
follows it

21:41.840 --> 21:42.320
that begins

21:42.320 --> 21:42.960
with a vowel

21:42.960 --> 21:43.460
you can

21:43.460 --> 21:44.280
if you want

21:44.280 --> 21:45.100
more or less

21:45.100 --> 21:46.860
push the s

21:46.860 --> 21:47.520
from the end

21:47.520 --> 21:48.820
of the word

21:48.820 --> 21:49.820
onto the vowel

21:49.820 --> 21:50.660
of the next one

21:50.660 --> 21:51.840
and so you can

21:51.840 --> 21:52.200
make

21:52.200 --> 21:52.800
vous avez

21:52.800 --> 21:54.200
sound instead

21:54.200 --> 21:54.620
like

21:54.620 --> 21:55.340
vous avez

21:55.340 --> 21:57.060
this is entirely

21:57.060 --> 21:57.960
optional and up

21:57.960 --> 21:58.420
to you

21:58.420 --> 22:00.040
so what I would

22:00.040 --> 22:00.520
say is

22:00.520 --> 22:01.400
do what you're

22:01.400 --> 22:02.000
more comfortable

22:02.000 --> 22:02.460
with

22:02.460 --> 22:04.020
but be aware

22:04.020 --> 22:04.680
at least

22:04.680 --> 22:05.900
that the French

22:05.900 --> 22:06.720
may well

22:06.720 --> 22:07.460
pronounce it

22:07.460 --> 22:07.800
as

22:07.800 --> 22:08.660
vous avez

22:08.660 --> 22:10.400
although

22:10.400 --> 22:10.880
although if

22:10.880 --> 22:11.340
you want

22:11.340 --> 22:11.660
you can

22:11.660 --> 22:11.920
also

22:11.920 --> 22:12.700
pronounce it

22:12.700 --> 22:13.080
as

22:13.080 --> 22:13.840
vous avez

22:13.840 --> 22:14.840
if you find

22:14.840 --> 22:15.360
it simpler

22:15.360 --> 22:16.080
to do so

22:16.080 --> 22:18.560
so

22:18.560 --> 22:19.980
for me

22:19.980 --> 22:20.640
in French

22:20.640 --> 22:21.060
is

22:21.060 --> 22:22.000
pour moi

22:22.000 --> 22:24.100
pour moi

22:24.100 --> 22:25.420
so how would

22:25.420 --> 22:25.860
you say

22:25.860 --> 22:26.860
you have

22:26.860 --> 22:27.420
prepared

22:27.420 --> 22:28.060
the coffee

22:28.060 --> 22:28.460
for me

22:28.460 --> 22:29.700
now make

22:29.700 --> 22:30.160
sure

22:30.160 --> 22:30.900
when you're

22:30.900 --> 22:31.660
saying this

22:31.660 --> 22:32.600
to include

22:32.600 --> 22:33.320
all the

22:33.320 --> 22:34.040
components

22:34.040 --> 22:35.660
so you'll

22:35.660 --> 22:35.880
need

22:35.880 --> 22:37.040
you have

22:37.040 --> 22:37.760
prepared

22:37.760 --> 22:38.840
the coffee

22:38.840 --> 22:40.040
for me

22:40.040 --> 22:47.900
vous avez

22:47.900 --> 22:48.820
préparé

22:48.820 --> 22:49.540
le café

22:49.540 --> 22:50.360
pour moi

22:50.360 --> 22:52.900
now to turn

22:52.900 --> 22:53.480
that into a

22:53.480 --> 22:53.940
question

22:53.940 --> 22:55.180
all you need

22:55.180 --> 22:55.640
to do

22:55.640 --> 22:56.200
is to

22:56.200 --> 22:57.460
change the

22:57.460 --> 22:58.120
order of

22:58.120 --> 22:58.700
the words

22:58.700 --> 22:59.380
you have

22:59.380 --> 23:00.440
so again

23:00.440 --> 23:01.140
how would

23:01.140 --> 23:01.600
you say

23:01.600 --> 23:02.500
you have

23:02.500 --> 23:03.080
in French

23:03.080 --> 23:06.640
vous avez

23:06.640 --> 23:08.160
now let's

23:08.160 --> 23:08.640
turn that

23:08.640 --> 23:09.060
round

23:09.060 --> 23:10.360
and make

23:10.360 --> 23:10.680
it into

23:10.680 --> 23:11.140
a question

23:11.140 --> 23:11.540
make it

23:11.540 --> 23:11.740
into

23:11.740 --> 23:12.360
have you

23:12.360 --> 23:12.820
how would

23:12.820 --> 23:13.120
you say

23:13.120 --> 23:13.640
have you

23:13.640 --> 23:16.640
avez-vous

23:16.640 --> 23:18.740
so how would

23:18.740 --> 23:19.240
you say

23:19.240 --> 23:20.100
have you

23:20.100 --> 23:20.500
prepared

23:20.500 --> 23:20.980
the coffee

23:20.980 --> 23:21.480
for me

23:21.480 --> 23:26.280
avez-vous

23:26.280 --> 23:26.900

pour moi

23:28.000 --> 23:29.620
how would

23:29.620 --> 23:30.120
you say

23:30.120 --> 23:31.640
I have

23:31.640 --> 23:32.200
prepared

23:32.200 --> 23:33.020
roast beef

23:33.020 --> 23:33.480
for dinner

23:33.480 --> 23:34.540
have you

23:34.540 --> 23:34.900
prepared

23:34.900 --> 23:35.480
the coffee

23:35.480 --> 23:37.100
so let's

23:37.100 --> 23:37.400
start with

23:37.400 --> 23:38.000
that first

23:38.000 --> 23:38.320
bit

23:38.320 --> 23:39.500
with I

23:39.500 --> 23:40.140
have prepared

23:40.140 --> 23:40.880

sure when

23:52.600 --> 23:53.040
you're saying

23:53.040 --> 23:53.520
the dinner

23:53.520 --> 23:54.160
in French

23:54.160 --> 23:54.460
that you

23:54.460 --> 23:55.060

23:56.220 --> 23:57.540
that sort

23:57.540 --> 23:57.860
of a

23:57.860 --> 23:58.300
sound at

23:58.300 --> 23:58.580
the end

23:58.580 --> 23:58.940
of it

23:58.940 --> 24:00.640
good and

24:00.640 --> 24:00.980
the next

24:00.980 --> 24:01.440
part

24:01.440 --> 24:02.620
have you

24:02.620 --> 24:03.040

simply

change

28:43.000 --> 28:43.200
the

28:43.200 --> 28:43.440

28:45.520 --> 28:46.400
we

28:46.400 --> 28:46.560

okay

in english

28:51.540 --> 28:52.300

asian

28:54.800 --> 28:56.760

28:56.760 --> 28:58.120
make

28:58.120 --> 28:58.140
make

28:58.140 --> 28:58.160
make

and

28:59.240 --> 28:59.360
you

28:59.360 --> 28:59.640
find

28:59.640 --> 28:59.800

french

29:00.060 --> 29:00.480
word

so

29:01.840 --> 29:02.080
for

29:02.080 --> 29:02.520
instance

29:02.520 --> 29:03.140
how

29:03.140 --> 29:03.460
do you

29:03.460 --> 29:03.740
think

29:03.740 --> 29:04.000
you'd

29:04.000 --> 29:04.460
pronounce

29:04.460 --> 29:05.380
reservation

29:05.380 --> 29:06.120

29:06.120 --> 29:11.380
let's

29:11.380 --> 29:11.580
try

another

29:11.840 --> 29:12.140

about

29:13.540 --> 29:14.540
decoration

29:14.540 --> 29:19.900
so

29:19.900 --> 29:20.220
very

29:20.220 --> 29:20.580
clearly

29:20.580 --> 29:20.840
at the

29:20.840 --> 29:21.020
end

29:21.020 --> 29:21.240
that

29:21.240 --> 29:21.700
asian

29:21.700 --> 29:22.320
becomes

29:22.320 --> 29:23.140
asian

29:23.140 --> 29:24.520
as long

29:24.520 --> 29:24.720
as you

29:24.720 --> 29:24.880
make

29:24.880 --> 29:25.060
that

29:25.060 --> 29:25.640
change

29:25.640 --> 29:26.300
you

29:26.300 --> 29:26.460
have

29:28.460 --> 29:29.080
in french

29:29.080 --> 29:29.420
and

29:29.420 --> 29:29.520
it

29:29.520 --> 29:29.700
only

29:29.700 --> 29:30.000
takes

29:30.000 --> 29:30.280
a few

29:30.280 --> 29:30.640
seconds

29:30.640 --> 29:30.880
to

29:30.880 --> 29:31.180

29:31.180 --> 29:32.280
let's

29:32.280 --> 29:32.500

29:33.300 --> 29:33.800
slightly

29:33.800 --> 29:34.120
more

29:34.120 --> 29:34.400
tricky

29:34.400 --> 29:34.700
this

29:34.700 --> 29:35.040
time

29:35.040 --> 29:35.940
we're

29:35.940 --> 29:36.060

it's

29:59.460 --> 29:59.760
a very

29:59.760 --> 30:00.060
easy

30:00.060 --> 30:00.260
way

it's

30:15.060 --> 30:15.160
a

30:15.160 --> 30:15.340
matter

30:15.340 --> 30:15.480
of

43:14.040 --> 43:15.580
now

43:15.580 --> 43:16.000
they're

43:16.000 --> 43:16.260
spelt

43:16.260 --> 43:16.740
differently

43:16.740 --> 43:17.360
but

43:17.360 --> 43:17.480
if

43:17.480 --> 43:17.600
you're

43:17.600 --> 43:17.800
learning

43:17.800 --> 43:18.000
to

43:18.000 --> 43:18.260
speak

43:18.260 --> 43:18.540
French

43:18.540 --> 43:19.040
particularly

43:19.040 --> 43:19.380
it

43:19.380 --> 43:19.660
doesn't

43:19.660 --> 43:19.980
matter

43:19.980 --> 43:20.380
it

43:20.380 --> 43:20.540
just

43:20.540 --> 43:20.800
makes

43:20.800 --> 43:20.940
it

43:20.940 --> 43:21.300
easier

43:21.300 --> 43:22.040
because

43:22.040 --> 43:22.380
you only

43:22.380 --> 43:22.580
ever

43:22.580 --> 43:22.780
need

43:22.780 --> 43:22.940
to

43:22.940 --> 43:23.140
worry

43:23.140 --> 43:23.440
about

43:23.440 --> 43:23.940
saying

43:23.940 --> 43:26.820
so

43:26.820 --> 43:27.660
I would

43:27.660 --> 43:28.060
like

43:28.060 --> 43:28.260
in

43:28.260 --> 43:28.800
French

43:28.800 --> 43:29.200

43:29.200 --> 43:29.780
like

43:29.780 --> 43:30.380
is

43:30.380 --> 43:35.260
so

43:35.260 --> 43:35.480
how

say

43:36.120 --> 43:36.560
I would

to

43:45.080 --> 43:45.480

43:45.480 --> 43:46.000

something

49:40.120 --> 49:40.340
we'll

don't

49:43.240 --> 49:43.440

so

49:48.160 --> 49:48.320
it

49:48.320 --> 49:48.520
can

49:48.520 --> 49:48.820

51:39.980 --> 51:40.160
a

51:40.160 --> 51:40.440
look

51:40.440 --> 51:40.720
at

51:40.720 --> 51:40.840
a

51:40.840 --> 51:41.000
very

51:41.000 --> 51:41.480
simple

51:41.480 --> 51:41.820
word

51:41.820 --> 51:41.960
in

51:41.960 --> 51:42.400
English

51:42.400 --> 51:42.900
let's

51:42.900 --> 51:43.140
take

51:43.140 --> 51:43.340
the

51:43.340 --> 51:43.680
word

51:43.680 --> 51:44.500
room

51:44.500 --> 51:44.680
in

51:44.680 --> 51:45.140
English

51:45.140 --> 51:46.560
now

51:46.560 --> 51:47.300
is

51:47.300 --> 51:48.000
room

51:48.000 --> 51:48.760
a

51:48.760 --> 51:49.040
long

51:49.040 --> 51:49.300
or

51:49.300 --> 51:49.660
short

51:49.660 --> 51:50.140
word

51:52.920 --> 51:54.620
and

51:54.620 --> 51:54.820
does

51:54.820 --> 51:54.960
it

51:54.960 --> 51:55.320
sound

51:55.320 --> 51:56.040
Germanic

51:56.040 --> 51:56.320
or

51:56.320 --> 51:56.900
French

51:56.900 --> 51:59.020
perhaps

51:59.020 --> 51:59.160
you

51:59.160 --> 51:59.320
don't

51:59.320 --> 51:59.460
know

51:59.460 --> 51:59.560
at

51:59.560 --> 51:59.720
this

51:59.720 --> 52:00.140
stage

52:00.140 --> 52:05.020
as

52:05.020 --> 52:05.140
I

52:05.140 --> 52:05.420
mentioned

52:05.420 --> 52:05.700
at the

52:05.700 --> 52:06.100
beginning

52:06.100 --> 52:07.200
the

52:07.200 --> 52:07.520
short

52:07.520 --> 52:07.840
words

52:07.840 --> 52:07.980
in

52:07.980 --> 52:08.420
English

52:08.420 --> 52:09.240
tend

52:09.240 --> 52:09.580
to

52:09.580 --> 52:10.000
be

52:10.000 --> 52:10.620
of

52:10.620 --> 52:11.200
Germanic

52:11.200 --> 52:12.200
Anglo-Saxon

52:12.200 --> 52:12.860
origin

52:12.860 --> 52:14.080
so

52:14.080 --> 52:14.500
a word

52:14.500 --> 52:14.800
like

52:14.800 --> 52:15.380
room

52:15.380 --> 52:15.780
is

52:15.780 --> 52:16.100
more

52:16.100 --> 52:16.400
likely

52:16.400 --> 52:16.620
than

52:16.620 --> 52:16.860
not

52:16.860 --> 52:17.060
to

52:17.060 --> 52:17.200
have

52:17.200 --> 52:17.540
come

52:17.540 --> 52:18.080
from

52:18.080 --> 52:18.220
the

52:18.220 --> 52:18.600
Germanic

52:18.600 --> 52:18.860
part

52:18.860 --> 52:18.980
of

52:18.980 --> 52:19.080
the

52:19.080 --> 52:19.540
language

52:19.540 --> 52:20.840
so

52:20.840 --> 52:20.960
if

52:20.960 --> 52:21.040
we

52:21.040 --> 52:21.240
want

52:21.240 --> 52:21.400
to

52:21.400 --> 52:21.800
find

52:21.800 --> 52:22.040
what

52:22.040 --> 52:22.220
the

52:22.220 --> 52:22.480
word

52:22.480 --> 52:22.840
for

52:22.840 --> 52:23.320
room

52:23.320 --> 52:23.480
is

52:23.480 --> 52:23.700
in

52:23.700 --> 52:24.200
French

52:24.200 --> 52:25.100
we

52:25.100 --> 52:25.320
can

52:25.320 --> 52:25.620
look

52:25.620 --> 52:26.040
in

52:26.040 --> 52:26.280
other

52:26.280 --> 52:26.640
areas

52:26.640 --> 52:26.780
of

52:26.780 --> 52:27.040
English

52:27.040 --> 52:27.240
and

52:27.240 --> 52:27.420
see

52:27.420 --> 52:27.560
if

52:27.560 --> 52:27.780
there's

52:27.780 --> 52:27.900
an

52:27.900 --> 52:28.380
alternative

52:28.380 --> 52:28.820
perhaps

52:28.820 --> 52:29.040
a

52:29.040 --> 52:29.320
longer

52:29.320 --> 52:29.840
word

52:29.840 --> 52:30.540
perhaps

52:30.540 --> 52:30.720
it's

52:30.720 --> 52:30.900
not

52:30.900 --> 52:31.240
used

52:31.240 --> 52:31.420
as

52:31.420 --> 52:31.760
much

52:31.760 --> 52:32.740
but

52:32.740 --> 52:32.880
we

52:32.880 --> 52:33.040
can

52:33.040 --> 52:33.240
use

52:33.240 --> 52:33.500
tricks

52:33.500 --> 52:33.780
like

52:33.780 --> 52:34.060
this

52:34.060 --> 52:34.280
to

52:34.280 --> 52:34.600
find

52:34.600 --> 52:35.260
vocabulary

52:35.260 --> 52:37.020
and

52:37.020 --> 52:37.700
as

52:37.700 --> 52:37.880
I've

52:37.880 --> 52:38.080
often

52:38.080 --> 52:38.340
said

52:38.340 --> 52:38.460
to

52:38.460 --> 52:38.660
people

52:38.660 --> 52:39.080
before

52:39.080 --> 52:39.420
it's

52:39.420 --> 52:39.660
much

52:39.660 --> 52:40.020
easier

52:40.020 --> 52:40.200
to

52:40.200 --> 52:40.540
invent

52:40.540 --> 52:41.180
vocabulary

52:41.180 --> 52:41.620
than

52:41.620 --> 52:41.760
to

52:41.760 --> 52:42.020
memorize

52:42.020 --> 52:42.420
it

52:42.420 --> 52:42.780
if

52:42.780 --> 52:42.860
you

52:42.860 --> 52:43.020
can

52:43.020 --> 52:43.360
invent

52:43.360 --> 52:43.500
it

52:43.500 --> 52:43.640
you

52:43.640 --> 52:43.780
can

52:43.780 --> 52:44.020
invent

52:44.020 --> 52:44.380
thousands

52:44.380 --> 52:44.620
of

52:44.620 --> 52:44.900
words

52:44.900 --> 52:45.320
if

52:45.320 --> 52:45.420
you

52:45.420 --> 52:45.780
memorize

52:45.780 --> 52:46.220
it

52:46.220 --> 52:46.480
takes

52:46.480 --> 52:46.820
weeks

52:46.820 --> 52:47.040
to

52:47.040 --> 52:47.220
learn

52:47.220 --> 52:47.340
a

52:47.340 --> 52:47.620
hundred

52:47.620 --> 52:49.060
now

52:49.060 --> 52:49.340
let's

52:49.340 --> 52:49.620
think

52:49.620 --> 52:50.080
about

52:50.080 --> 52:50.740
those

52:50.740 --> 52:51.160
words

52:51.160 --> 52:51.360
we

52:51.360 --> 52:51.620
do

52:51.620 --> 52:52.000
have

52:52.000 --> 52:52.240
for

52:52.240 --> 52:52.560
room

52:52.560 --> 52:52.700
in

52:52.700 --> 52:53.200
English

52:53.200 --> 52:54.180
for

52:54.180 --> 52:54.560
instance

52:54.560 --> 52:55.140
we

52:55.140 --> 52:55.340
can

52:55.340 --> 52:55.620
say

52:55.620 --> 52:56.240
bedroom

52:56.240 --> 52:56.440
in

52:56.440 --> 52:56.860
English

52:56.860 --> 52:57.600
but

52:57.600 --> 52:57.820
there's

52:57.820 --> 52:58.300
also

52:58.300 --> 52:58.620
a

52:58.620 --> 52:58.820
more

52:58.820 --> 52:59.040
old

52:59.040 --> 52:59.420
fashioned

52:59.420 --> 52:59.760
way

52:59.760 --> 52:59.980
to

52:59.980 --> 53:00.340
refer

53:00.340 --> 53:00.560
to

53:00.560 --> 53:00.740
the

53:00.740 --> 53:01.200
bedroom

53:01.200 --> 53:02.020
perhaps

53:02.020 --> 53:02.160
you

53:02.160 --> 53:02.280
can

53:02.280 --> 53:02.440
think

53:02.440 --> 53:02.540
of

53:02.540 --> 53:02.640
an

53:02.640 --> 53:03.080
example

53:03.080 --> 53:06.960
if

53:06.960 --> 53:07.080
you're

53:07.080 --> 53:07.220
not

53:07.220 --> 53:07.420
able

53:07.420 --> 53:07.580
to

53:07.580 --> 53:07.780
get

53:07.780 --> 53:07.920
it

53:07.920 --> 53:08.080
by

53:08.080 --> 53:08.500
yourself

53:08.500 --> 53:08.720
I'll

53:08.720 --> 53:08.840
give

53:08.840 --> 53:08.940
you

53:08.940 --> 53:09.140
some

53:09.140 --> 53:09.500
help

53:09.500 --> 53:11.980
for

53:11.980 --> 53:12.360
instance

53:12.360 --> 53:12.760
perhaps

53:12.760 --> 53:13.600
even

53:13.600 --> 53:13.980
now

53:13.980 --> 53:14.260
one

53:14.260 --> 53:14.740
talks

53:14.740 --> 53:15.040
about

53:15.040 --> 53:15.360
something

53:15.360 --> 53:15.640
like

53:15.640 --> 53:15.820
the

53:15.820 --> 53:16.300
queen's

53:16.300 --> 53:16.660
bed

53:16.660 --> 53:17.380
chamber

53:17.380 --> 53:18.260
rather

53:18.260 --> 53:18.420
than

53:18.420 --> 53:18.560
the

53:18.560 --> 53:18.960
queen's

53:18.960 --> 53:19.500
bedroom

53:19.500 --> 53:20.820
and

53:20.820 --> 53:20.960
so

53:20.960 --> 53:21.100
we

53:21.100 --> 53:21.320
also

53:21.320 --> 53:21.540
have

53:21.540 --> 53:21.660
the

53:21.660 --> 53:21.940
word

53:21.940 --> 53:22.660
chamber

53:22.660 --> 53:23.100
that

53:23.100 --> 53:23.420
means

53:23.420 --> 53:23.640
for

53:23.640 --> 53:24.060
room

53:24.060 --> 53:24.960
rather

53:24.960 --> 53:25.080
than

53:25.080 --> 53:25.300
simply

53:25.300 --> 53:25.500
using

53:25.500 --> 53:25.740
room

53:25.740 --> 53:25.900
we

53:25.900 --> 53:26.080
use

53:26.080 --> 53:26.180
it

53:26.180 --> 53:26.420
less

53:26.420 --> 53:26.800
often

53:26.800 --> 53:27.160
but

53:27.160 --> 53:27.260
it

53:27.260 --> 53:27.420
does

53:27.420 --> 53:27.860
exist

53:27.860 --> 53:28.060
in

53:28.060 --> 53:28.500
English

53:28.500 --> 53:29.600
again

53:29.600 --> 53:29.780
as

53:29.780 --> 53:29.980
I've

53:29.980 --> 53:30.700
said

53:30.700 --> 53:31.380
typically

53:31.380 --> 53:32.060
short

53:32.060 --> 53:32.400
words

53:32.400 --> 53:32.600
are

53:32.600 --> 53:33.060
Germanic

53:33.060 --> 53:33.820
longer

53:33.820 --> 53:34.280
words

53:34.280 --> 53:34.840
are

53:34.840 --> 53:35.340
French

53:35.340 --> 53:36.480
so

53:36.480 --> 53:36.660
we

53:36.660 --> 53:36.820
have

53:36.820 --> 53:37.280
chamber

53:37.280 --> 53:37.480
in

53:37.480 --> 53:37.920
English

53:37.920 --> 53:39.840
now

53:39.840 --> 53:40.000
this

53:40.000 --> 53:40.220
leads

53:40.220 --> 53:40.360
us

53:40.360 --> 53:40.480
to

53:40.480 --> 53:40.740
another

53:40.740 --> 53:41.100
useful

53:41.100 --> 53:41.540
rule

53:41.540 --> 53:42.620
words

53:42.620 --> 53:42.840
that

53:42.840 --> 53:43.120
end

53:43.120 --> 53:43.340
in

53:43.340 --> 53:43.980
amber

53:43.980 --> 53:44.640
in

53:44.640 --> 53:45.160
English

53:45.160 --> 53:46.700
generally

53:46.700 --> 53:47.140
exist

53:47.140 --> 53:47.400
in

53:47.400 --> 53:47.900
French

53:47.900 --> 53:48.820
except

53:48.820 --> 53:49.500
the

53:49.500 --> 53:50.020
amber

53:50.020 --> 53:50.840
becomes

53:50.840 --> 53:51.580
ambre

53:51.580 --> 53:52.980
and

53:52.980 --> 53:53.320
actually

53:53.320 --> 53:53.560
the

53:53.560 --> 53:53.820
word

53:53.820 --> 53:54.020
for

is

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.500
Si

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.900
The if

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.360
sounds a

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:55.680
bit more

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.100
like the

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.520
sea that

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:56.780
you would

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.240
swim in

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:57.620
a little

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.100
bit like

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.480
that

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.540
but shorter

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.920
and the

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.400
it is

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:01.880
sounds a

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.220
bit more

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:02.600
like the

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:02.820
English

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.120
word

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.600
say

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.280
but it's

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:04.740
not pronounced

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.220
as clearly

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:05.760
as that

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.220
but that's

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:07.660
the difference

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:08.520
one veers

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.240
more towards

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.160
see and

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.480
the other

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:10.920
towards

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.300
say

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.820
but again

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:13.340
there are

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:13.800
no exact

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.280
equivalents

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:14.700
because it's

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.020
a different

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:15.500
language

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.200
so again

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:17.500
one more

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:17.820
time

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.120
if

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:18.460
is

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.040
Si

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.080
and it

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:20.320
is

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:20.660
is

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.100
Si

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.340
Let's move

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:23.820
on to another

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:24.500
word now

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.520
the word for

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.500
but in French

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:26.900
is

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.560
Mais

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.460
Mais

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.300
So how

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:31.660
would you

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.080
