WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.240
now you may have noticed that we've introduced quite a large number of terms early on but again

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.340
as I stated at the outset you shouldn't worry or concern yourself particularly with remembering

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.340
all of them in fact it's not a bad thing to forget forget them at all as you'll have noticed

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.300
I've already started reintroducing concepts that we mentioned early on and this will happen

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.940
throughout the course so again always trying to remember and never letting yourself forget

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.560
anything wouldn't be a good thing if you're forgetting words that's a good thing they will

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.980
come up and by the end of the course you will know them and you will understand how to use them in

00:00:50.980 --> 00:01:03.820
french as we mentioned earlier it is in french's c'est it is not in french's ce n'est pas ce n'est pas

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.860
how would you say it's not romantic

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.740
ce n'est pas romantique it's not exotic

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.940
ce n'est pas exotique

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.460
how would you say i would like to know if it's not exotic

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:36.520
je voudrais savoir si ce n'est pas exotique

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.800
the word for why in french is pourquoi

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.420
pourquoi

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.160
which literally means for what

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:55.240
so in english you could say why do i have to do this but you might also say for what reason do i have to do it

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
and in french they'll always say for what

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240
for for what do i have to go there

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.380
for what reason do i have to do it so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.220
pourquoi is for what

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.340
with that in mind

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.300
how would you say i would like to know why it's not romantic

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:33.920
how would you say i would like to know why you have prepared the dinner

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:59.300
so what is you have in french

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.020
you have

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:08.240
how would you say you have a room

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.420
a chamber

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.620
for two people for two persons for two nights

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.940
so you have a room for two people for two nights

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:30.800
now you can actually turn that into a question in french

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.060
by simply

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.740
raising your voice at the end of the question

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.140
so you say something

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.000
instead of saying you have a room for two people for two nights

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.500
you'll say

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.140
you have a room for two people for two nights

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.800
that's a very typical way to ask a question in french

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.940
we do it we do it in english as well

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.280
but nowhere near as much as the french do

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.260
and often in english we do it to in

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.900
to express disbelief or incredulity

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.940
and say something like

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.600
you have a room for two people for two nights

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.120
it's it's perhaps suggesting something else in english

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.700
but in french

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.520
it's just a very typical way to ask a question

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.200
without any extra meaning

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.860
so again let's practice that one more time

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.200
how would you say as a statement

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.440
you have a room for two people for two nights

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:28.500
vous avez une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500
now let's try turning that into a question

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.120
simply by saying it again

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120
but raising your voice at the end

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.560
and saying you have a room for two people for two nights

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:48.660
vous avez une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.140
it's a very typical way to do it in french

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.060
and quite easy

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.600
because if you know how to make the statement

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.120
you can make the question

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.060
and again it's very very typical way

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.840
that the french actually speak

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.880
let's um let's give an answer to that question

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.060
and say yes

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.000
i have a room for two persons

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:21.440
oui j'ai une chambre pour deux personnes

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.560
so the person telling you that they have a room for two people

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.440
may also mention some of the other things it has

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.340
for instance they may mention it has a shower

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.060
and the word for shower in french is

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.780
douche

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.340
douche

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.940
to say with a shower

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.140
or with shower

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.900
the french will say

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.140
avec douche

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.500
avec douche

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.800
so how would you say

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.720
yes i have a room for two people

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.740
with shower

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:10.940
oui j'ai une chambre pour deux personnes

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.000
avec douche

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.280
so again

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.700
what is you have

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.900
you have in french

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.840
vous avez

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.080
to say you have not

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.220
or you don't have

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.720
which is the same in french

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.280
you would say

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.420
vous n'avez pas

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.280
vous n'avez pas

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.480
so we have the positive

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.740
one which is you have

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.220
which is

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.880
vous avez

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.180
and there are a few things

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.060
that are going on there

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.620
to make it negative in french

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.100
the most important

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.740
is the final word

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.620
the final word

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.280
which is

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.700
pas

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.080
and that means not in french

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.220
that means not

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.580
but you might also have heard

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.200
there's a sort of an n sound

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.800
in there

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.400
an n

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.000
so if we have the whole thing again

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.760
you have not

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.060
is

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.260
vous n'avez pas

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.880
there's a sound of an n early on

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.480
and all that is

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.980
is that is a negative warning

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.820
it's an n for a negative warning

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.220
saying something negative

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.960
is coming up

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.180
because of course

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.000
you have not

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.260
is a negative sentence

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.980
it's not positive

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.820
like you have

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.560
so let's go back to you have again

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.100
which is

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.860
vous avez

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.640
but you don't have

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.880
is

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.000
vous n'avez pas

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.680
so we have the not on the end

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.640
for the you do not have

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.100
but you'll notice

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.140
before the avez

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.620
there's a little n sound

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.040
and vous avez

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040
becomes

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.160
vous n'avez

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.820
vous n'avez

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.300
and then for the whole thing

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.840
you have not

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.300
we have

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.400
vous n'avez pas

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.680
ok

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.280
so how would you say

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.720
you have not

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.120
reserved a room

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.480
vous n'avez pas

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.860
réservé une chambre

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.320
and how would you say

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.900
I would like to know

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.380
why

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.220
you haven't

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.120
reserved a room

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:11.140
je voudrais savoir

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.740

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.040
réservé une chambre

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.320
how would you say

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.980
I would like to know

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.500

you haven't

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.640
prepared the dinner

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.460
I'm hungry

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.220
let's go back

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.600
and start early on

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.180

prepared

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.500
the dinner

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.960

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.900
préparé le dîner

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.260
and then

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.240
I'm hungry

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.740
literally

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.780
I have hunger

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.040

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.560
let's go back

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.060
to the beginning

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.420
I have prepared

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:12.920
the dinner

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.780

préparé

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:36.940

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.540

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.020
put the whole

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.620
thing together

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.580
I've prepared

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.140
the dinner

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.380
and I would

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.220
like to know

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.420
why you haven't

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.860
prepared

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.560
the coffee

00:09:48.560 --> 00:10:06.600
now again

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.380
a lot

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:07.680
of new

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.260
vocabulary

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.220
a lot

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.580
of new

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.160
concepts

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.560
have been

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:10.960
introduced

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.580
here

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.860
on the one

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.100
hand

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.540
I don't want

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.780
you to

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.140
actively

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.680
try and

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.100
remember

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.500
I'd prefer

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:17.880
it if you

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.340
actually let

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.220
yourself forget

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.300
however

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:20.980
if you feel

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.640
you're struggling

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.040
at all

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.840
at this point

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.480
or a little

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.340
bit confused

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.340
feel free

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:25.920
to go back

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.320
a track

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:26.720
or two

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.620
and re-listen

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.460
because you'll

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:28.980
find the second

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.580
time round

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.060
it will be

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.780
far easier

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:39.200
so again

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.600
what is

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.180
you have

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.640
vous avez

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.540
and you

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.240
have not

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.860
vous n'avez

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.180
pas

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.220
what is

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.100
I have

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.300
j'ai

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.360
I have

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.700
not

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.200
works in

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.540
a similar

00:10:59.540 --> 00:10:59.900
way

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.720
the word

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.260
for not

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:01.740
is of

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.140
course

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:02.720
pas

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.020
and I

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.200
have

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.500
not

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:04.840
is

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.160
je n'ai

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.380
pas

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.260
so again

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.540
let's go

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:08.880
back to

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.400
just I

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.760
have

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.320
which is

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:10.840
j'ai

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.680
and I

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:11.820
have

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.240
not

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.940
je n'ai

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.200
pas

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.680
so again

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.020
you have

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.760
that not

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.180
at the

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.660
end

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.380
the pas

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.560
and that

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:19.840
comes at

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.120
the end

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.500
but you

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:20.840
really

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.440
incorrect

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:21.840
French

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.140
you do

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:22.400
need to

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:22.680
have a

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.040
negative

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.600
warning

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.020
to tell

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.280

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.260
so I

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:26.560
have

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.120
is that

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.020
faire

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.080
today

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.400
in

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:32.720
french

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.280
today

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:33.840
is

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.880
aujourd'hui

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.680
aujourd'hui

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.740
she

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.100
can do

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.220
it

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.680
today

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:47.860
good

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.740
if

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.040
she

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.420
can

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:51.780
is

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.480
elle

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:52.740
peut

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.200
how do

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:54.640
you think

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.280
you would

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:55.680
say

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.220
she

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:56.980
cannot

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.240
elle

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:01.400
ne

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:01.560
peut

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:01.840
pas

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.920
so

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.480
she

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.920
cannot

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.200
do

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.340
it

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:05.820
today

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.060
I

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.780
cannot

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.040
do

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.180
it

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:17.860
today

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.900
I

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.240
cannot

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.680
do

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.660
it

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:24.900
today

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.640
he

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:26.920
cannot

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.120
do

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.220
it

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:27.520
today

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.080
he

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.900
cannot

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:33.700
do

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.000
it

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.840
today

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.460
I

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.960
cannot

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.920
do

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.460
it

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.180
You can in French is

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.000
Vous pouvez

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.960
How would you say you can do it?

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.200
Vous pouvez le faire

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.800
You can do it today

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.160
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.280
Now, as I mentioned earlier

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.120
one of the ways you can ask a question in French

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.020
is simply to raise your voice at the end

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.700
So, let's try that sentence again

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.820
You can do it today

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.640
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.460
In order to make that into a question

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.200
and ask

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.720
Can you do it today?

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.160
In French, perhaps the easiest way

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.360
is simply to use a rising intonation at the end

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.720
and raise your voice at the end of it

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.100
and say

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.740
You can do it today

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.500
How would you say that?

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.980
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.980
That isn't the only way, however

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.580
to ask a question in French

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.340
It's certainly one of the easiest

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.740
But another way

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.700
is to invert the sentence order

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.060
So, for instance

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.580
What is you can

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.500
You can

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.500
Vous pouvez

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.700
Now, you can also ask a question

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.780
by simply changing round the order

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.580
as we do in English

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.980
from you can to can you

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.760
So

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.040
You can, which is

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.960
Vous pouvez

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.380
Will become

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.780
Pouvez-vous

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.160
So, using that construction

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.200
how would you say

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.300
Can you do it today?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:28.420
Can you do it today?

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.380
Pouvez-vous

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:33.400
Pouvez-vous

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.300
le faire aujourd'hui?

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.440
Can you eat it?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.360
Pouvez-vous

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.820
le manger?

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.020
Now, try

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.440
Same sentence

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.540
Can you eat it?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.320
But simply

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.560
using the rising intonation

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.860
So, you can eat it

00:23:53.860 --> 00:24:04.660
Finally, there is still another way

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.900
to ask a question in French

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.840
Again, it's not important

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.800
to remember all of these

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.380
at the moment

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.480
You'll be able to remember

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.900
by the time we finish the course

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.080
as there's going to be ample time

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.300
to practice each of them

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.380
The other way to ask a question in French

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.260
is to use

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.820
Is it that?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.880
Is it that?

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.360
It sounds very formal to us

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.360
but to a French person

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.320
it's a very normal way

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.220
to ask a question

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.600
So, is it that in French

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:30.960
is

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.880
Est-ce que?

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.500
Est-ce que?

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.240
And what they do

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:35.900
is they simply

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.520
the French

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.340
French speakers

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.060
will put

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.400
Is it that?

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.540
in front of a statement

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.340
So, for something like

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.840
You can do it today

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.900
Let's start with that

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.580
How would you say

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.720
You can do it today?

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.220
Vous pouvez le faire aujourd'hui

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.900
Now, simply add

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.860
Is it that?

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.540
in front of the sentence

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.560
and you'll get literally

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.840
Is it that you can do it today?

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:03.640
Which in French

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.480
simply means

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.300
Can you do it today?

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.940
So, is it that you can do it today?

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:14.460
Est-ce que vous pouvez

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.340
le faire aujourd'hui?

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.320
Let's go back

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:18.960
to what we were doing

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.880
just a moment ago

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.040
What is I can?

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.000
Je peux

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.880
He can

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.820
Il peut

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.240
She can

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.860
Elle peut

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.620
You can

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.880
Vous pouvez

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.200
Can you eat it?

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.860
Pouvez-vous le manger?

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.760
That's one way to do it

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.880
Let's try it now

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.020
with a rising intonation instead

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:58.540
Vous pouvez le manger?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.680
Finally

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.480
You can also use

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.500
Is it that?

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.060
So

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.320
Is it that

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.400
you can eat it?

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.500
Est-ce que vous pouvez le manger?

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.880
We can

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.320
is rather similar

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.340
to you can

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.600
It sounds quite similar

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.960
As you'll remember

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.100
you can was

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:25.980
Vous pouvez

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.220
We can

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:28.640
is

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.580
Nous pouvons

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.040
So at the end of you can

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.560
you have an

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.300
a sound

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.220
At the end of we can

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.900
you have an

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.660
on sound

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.240
Again

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.840
don't concern yourself

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.660
too much

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.400
about remembering this

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.060
Through the course

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.920
of these lessons

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.800
You'll be able

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.440
to remember it

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:47.900
naturally

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.440
and without

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.320
worrying about it

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:49.700
anyway

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.960
So

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.300
how would you say

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.060
We can do it?

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.260
Nous pouvons le faire

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.800
We can eat it

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.560
Nous pouvons le manger

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:14.200
To understand in French

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.500
is

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.500
Comprendre

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.000
Comprendre

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.940
How would you say

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.620
We can understand?

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.360
Nous pouvons comprendre

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.240
To understand it

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:31.940
will be

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.840
Le comprendre

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.580
So how would you say

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.320
We can understand it?

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.800
Nous pouvons le comprendre

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.320
How about

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.580
We can't understand it?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.080
Nous ne pouvons pas le comprendre

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.220
Let's break that down for a bit

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.040
We can is

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.220
Nous pouvons

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.720
But to say

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.880
We cannot is

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.040
Nous ne pouvons pas

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.780
Again

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.600
you can see that

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.400
there is a

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:14.880
pas

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.700
on the end

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.500
meaning not

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.380
and that there's also

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.540
a negative warning

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.020
earlier in the sentence

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:21.820
and that these

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.780
effectively form

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.660
a sort of sandwich

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.800
The pas

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.360
will be

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.460
one slice of bread

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.620
There must be

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.740
some sort of filling

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.920
which in this case

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.340
is the

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:30.980
pouvant

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.560
and then

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.160
we have the

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.900
negative warning

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:34.300
the ne

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.240
which is the

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.360
other slice of bread

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.460
So you have the ne

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.300
and the pas

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.840
which make a sandwich

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.760
They must have a filling

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.520
They're not going to be

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.200
next to each other

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.680
You're not going to have

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.420
an empty sandwich

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.640
but they will want to have

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.600
some sort of filling

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.760
So again

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.820
we cannot

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.340
is

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.600
Nous ne pouvons pas

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.720
and we cannot

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.640
understand it

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.320
Nous ne pouvons pas

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.060
le comprendre

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.560
We cannot eat it

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:10.240
Nous ne pouvons pas

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:10.780
le manger

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.660
We cannot do it

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.200
Nous ne pouvons pas

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.780
le faire

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.920
I cannot do it

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.400
Je ne peux pas

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:24.940
le faire

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.940
He cannot do it

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.400
Il ne peut pas

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:30.960
le faire

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.920
She cannot do it

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.560
Elle ne peut pas

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.120
le faire

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.440
Again

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:37.820
what is

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.340
you can

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.060
Vous pouvez

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.600
And we can

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.200
Nous pouvons

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.900
So you'll notice

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.760
that the you

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.500
and the we

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.320
forms are really

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.200
quite different

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:53.840
to the I

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.320
and the he

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.020
and the she

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.620
but quite similar

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.340
to one another

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.540
Again

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.320
you can

00:29:59.320 --> 00:29:59.660
is

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.660
Vous pouvez

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.100
And we can

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.200
Nous pouvons

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:14.580
The word

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.180
for they

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.080
in French

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.500
is

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.960
Il

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.400
Il

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.680
And the word

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.120
for he

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.760
in French

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.280
is also

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:22.840
of course

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.340
Il

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.700
Il

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.920
So they

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.640
sound the

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.080
same

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.580
In order

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.080
to find

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:30.880
they can

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.440
therefore

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.860
we can

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.520
start off

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.120
by going

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:34.620
to he

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.000
can

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.800
because

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.480
well I

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:36.800
mean they're

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.440
very similar

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:37.880
so probably

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.220
the word

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.620
for can

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.000
is going

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.360
to be

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:39.780
similar

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:40.280
for them

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.460
So

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.300
what was

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.000
he can

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.940
Il peut

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.480
They can

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:48.860
is going

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.500
to start

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.100
in exactly

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.680
the same

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.100
way

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.840
as

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.300
Il peut

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.580
Except of course

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.000
you're going

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.440
to need

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:56.960
something

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.780
to distinguish

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.140
it

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:58.600
from he

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:58.900
can

00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.880
The way

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.360
you're going

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.040
to distinguish

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:01.880
it from

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.140
he can

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.260
is by

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:04.680
adding

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.500
an additional

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.140
consonant

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.800
sound

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.960
at the end

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.560
of the word

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.840
The question

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.580
is of course

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.320
which consonant

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:12.840
are you going

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.340
to choose

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:13.980
to distinguish

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.360
it

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.340
Well

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.220
you can

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:17.800
find the

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.280
consonant

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.140
if you look

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.720
inside

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.300
you can

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.640
What was

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.140
you can

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:23.540
how would

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:23.820
you say

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.260
you can

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:24.760
in French

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:30.500
What you

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.040
will do

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:31.480
is you

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:31.860
will take

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.400
the middle

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.020
consonant

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.940
from the

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:34.300
can

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:34.860
from you

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.180
can

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.280
So you

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.860
can again

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.380
was

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.760
And you

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.240
can hear

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:42.800
a V

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.180
in the

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.420
middle

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:43.960
of that

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.080
It is

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.040
that V

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.620
sound

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.120
that you're

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.500
going to

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:47.900
add

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.340
to the

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:48.540
end

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:48.940
of he

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.480
can

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.240
which is

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.660
going to

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.180
make it

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.700
into they

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.020
can

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.160
So let's

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.500
go back

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:54.920
a second

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.500
What was

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:55.740
he

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.080
can

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.920
Now add

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.260
the V

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:00.620
sound

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.040
onto the

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.360
end

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:01.740
What will

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.140
you have

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:08.780
So a

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.220
good way

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:09.700
to find

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:09.900
the

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.240
they

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.140
can

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.800
is simply

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.100
to go

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.480
back to

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:12.680
he

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.080
can

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.920
and it

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.520
will start

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:14.820
in the

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.380
same way

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:15.840
except it

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.060
will have

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:16.480
an additional

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:16.940
consonant

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.300
sound

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:17.580
on the

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:17.820
end

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.920
So how

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.180
would you

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:22.480
say

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.060
they

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:23.340
can

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:23.940
understand

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.840
They

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.040
can

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.720
understand

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.440
it

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.280
The

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.780
word

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:41.200
for me

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.800
in French

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.200
is

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.880
So how

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.120
would you

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:46.620
say

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.700
to understand

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.200
me

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.100
Me

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.700
comprendre

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.620
Now

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.340
many

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:56.920
students

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.320
will want

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:57.660
to put

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:57.880
the

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.100
me

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.820
after

00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.440
comprendre

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.360
but if

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:01.840
we simply

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.480
go back

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:02.860
to what

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.140
we did

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:03.520
earlier

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.060
it will

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.660
make sense

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:04.900
that it

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.220
goes in

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:05.400
this

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:05.920
position

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.820
To

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.520
understand

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.020
is

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:08.980
comprendre

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.400
To

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.080
understand

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.680
it

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.200
is

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.720
Le

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.320
comprendre

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.660
And so

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.380
to understand

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:15.860
me

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.320
is

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:16.920
Me

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.560
comprendre

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.220
They

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:19.460
can

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:19.960
understand

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.880
me

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:32.200
They

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.260
can

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:34.940
So

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.000
they

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.420
can

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:36.780
is

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:41.080
understand

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.080
me

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.500
So, they can understand me.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.080
Ils peuvent me comprendre.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.080
They cannot understand me.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.240
Ils ne peuvent pas me comprendre.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.680
So the they can is

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.500
Ils peuvent

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.620
And they cannot is

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.720
Ils ne peuvent pas.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.780
Again, in the negative,

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.840
you have the same components.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.120
You have the same ne and pas

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.080
added to make it a sandwich.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.240
So you have

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.180
They can

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.080
Ils peuvent

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.480
Then we add

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.020
a pas after the perv

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.360
and a ne,

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.000
just a sound of an n almost,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.300
before the perv,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.840
making a little sandwich of it.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:33.760
Ne peuvent pas.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.200
They cannot

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.420
Ils ne peuvent pas.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.080
They cannot understand it.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:49.580
Ils ne peuvent pas le comprendre.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.120
They cannot understand me.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.340
Ils ne peuvent pas me comprendre.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.160
The word for you

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.160
that we have been using

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.980
the whole way through

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.680
is of course

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.120
Vous.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.820
How about

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.360
They cannot understand you.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.260
Let's start with

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:09.800
They cannot.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.060
Ils ne peuvent pas

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.800
understand you.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:21.060
Vous comprendre

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.360
Again, it will be

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.240
in the same position

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:24.920
as before.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.140
So, to understand it

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.500
is

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.960
Le comprendre

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.740
To understand me

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.120
Me comprendre

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.180
And to understand you

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:38.260
And to understand you.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.140
Vous comprendre

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.960
Back to the beginning again.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.320
What was I can?

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.000
Je peux

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.360
He can

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.300
Il peut

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.500
She can

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.680
Elle peut

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.820
You can

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:57.860
You can

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.720
Vous pouvez

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.300
We can

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.920
Nous pouvons

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.020
Finally, they can

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:15.460
If you forget

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:15.840
what the

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.440
they can

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.340
form is

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.680
simply start

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.480
by going back

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.300
to he can

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.020
which of course

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.140
starts in the same way

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.200
with il peut

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.780
You then only need

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.460
to remember

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.840
what

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.120
which particular

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.600
consonant sound

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:30.940
it is

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.660
that needs to be

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.560
added to the ending

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.820
In this case

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.680
it's a V sound

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:43.780
Again, how would you say

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.020
I can do it?

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.020
Je peux le faire

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.020
I can eat it

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.260
Je peux le manger

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.500
Now, make sure

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.480
at the end of

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.260
of these words

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.620
which

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.680
for instance

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.200
manger

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.260
to really sound

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.120
that A sound

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.800
at the end

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.040
So you've got

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.280
to eat

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.800
which is

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.880
manger

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.220
to prepare

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:14.920
which is

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.320
préparer

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320
to visit

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.180
which is

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.420
visiter

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.120
So you'll see

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:23.920
a lot of words

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.440
have that

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.120
A sound

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.680
at the end

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.240
and make sure

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:26.700
to make that

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.500
nice and clear

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:27.980
it helps you

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.880
to be understood

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.280
To see

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.000
in French

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.780
to see

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:34.460
is

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.380
voir

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.760
How would you say

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.700
to see it?

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.180
Le voir

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.500
How would you say

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.420
I can see it?

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.100
Je peux le voir

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.060
He can see it

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.960
Il peut le voir

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.220
She can see it

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.100
Elle peut le voir

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:18.480
Again, if you find

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.380
yourself particularly

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.360
struggling with any

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:20.860
of these

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.080
feel free to go

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:22.760
back a track

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.280
and have another

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:23.720
practice

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.600
the second time

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.160
it's always

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.280
far, far easier

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.720
All right

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.000
To say

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.940
to see

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.760
her

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.540
in French

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.340
you'll say

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.560
L'avoir

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.100
L'avoir

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.540
So it sounds

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.160
slightly different

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.660
than to see

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:38.940
it

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.960
So I can

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.620
see her

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.760
Je peux

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.480
la voir

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.760
Make sure

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.320
to make the

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.000
her very

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.700
clearly end

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.020
in an

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:49.660
A sound

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.080
as

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.860
La

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.760
He can

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.380
see her

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.500
Il peut

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.180
la voir

seem

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:22.920
very

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.300
odd

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:23.800
well

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:23.960
in

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.100
probably

wouldn't

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.000
this is

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.200
not

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:22.560
something

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.080
to worry

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.440
about

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.260
tremendously

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:24.640
in

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.160
French

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.080
there's

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:26.420
two

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:26.780
key

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.260
reasons

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:27.480
for

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:27.840
this

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.900
the

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:30.260
most

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.060
important

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.200
is

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:32.580
that

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:32.940
when

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.300
French

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:33.620
people

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.220
speak

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:34.520
they

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:34.720
tend

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:34.880
to

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:35.020
do

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:35.220
so

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:35.620
fairly

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.140
quickly

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.100
and

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.300
the

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:37.520
les

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.120
tend

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.400
to

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:39.540
be

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.040
obscured

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:40.420
slightly

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:40.780
simply

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:41.000
by

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.180
how

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:41.380
they're

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:41.800
pronounced

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.820
so

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.140
you

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:43.440
may

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:43.960
hear

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.320
I

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:44.500
can

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:44.800
see

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.100
it

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:45.680
as

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.000
a

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:46.400
quite

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.300
blurred

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.160
je peux

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:49.500
le voir

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:49.940
je peux

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.380
le voir

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.220
yeah

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:51.780
it won't

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.140
necessarily

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:52.780
be entirely

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.220
clear

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:53.940
so

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.500
it's

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:54.780
not

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.160
something

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:55.480
to worry

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:55.700
about

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.020
too

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:56.380
much

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:56.840
but

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.080
be

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.340
aware

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:57.460
of

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:57.620
its

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.140
existence

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.180
so

00:44:59.180 --> 00:44:59.400
one

00:44:59.400 --> 00:44:59.580
more

00:44:59.580 --> 00:44:59.940
time

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.160
in

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:00.420
asking

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:00.700
to see

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:00.860
the

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.040
room

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:01.220
how

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:01.340
would

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:01.440
you

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:01.640
say

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:01.980
I

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.120
can

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:02.340
see

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:02.560
it

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:02.920
I

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.060
can

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.280
see

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:03.520
her

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:09.660
now

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:09.900
let's

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:10.160
look at

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:10.380
a couple

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:10.500
of

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:10.600
the

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:10.800
things

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:10.940
that

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.140
might

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:11.360
come

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:11.520
with

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:11.640
the

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:11.960
room

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.900
we've

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.120
looked

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:13.360
at

with

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:13.980

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.940

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:19.080
you

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.220
might

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:19.440
also

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:19.640
have

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:19.800
the

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.120
option

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:20.280
of

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.020
you might

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.420
little bit

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:09.940
like the

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.600

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.480
combination

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.460

combien

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.260
so again

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:25.820
what is

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:26.400

even

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:24.920
easier

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.520
it is

the

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:25.920

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:32.520
you

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:32.700

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:44.440
simply

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:44.940
sounds

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.400
exactly

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:45.620
the

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.060
how

would

remember

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.000

much

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:42.200
and

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.520
then

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.660
of course

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.060
once you've

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:44.460
asked how

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:44.700
much

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.120
it is

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:45.500
they're

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:45.980
likely to

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.660
ask you

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:47.220
how

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:47.420
are you

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:47.720
paying

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:47.980
which

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.120
would

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:48.460
be

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:48.940
how

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:49.180
pay

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:49.460
you

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:59.880
obviously

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.200
there are

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:00.780
various ways

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.040
you could

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:01.400
pay

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.800
let's try

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.340
paying with

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:03.700
a credit

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.140
card

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.440
a credit

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:06.920
card in

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.460
French

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:07.880
to say

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.480
with a credit

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.980
card in

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:09.380
French

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.000
you'll

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:10.680
simply say

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.680
with a

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.720
card of

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.120
credit

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.480
with a card

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:14.860
of credit

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.300
and say it

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:15.480
in a

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.040
French way

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.140
so how

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:17.340
would you

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:17.740
say that

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.280
with a

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:18.680
card of

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.040
credit

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:28.440
the word

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:28.980
for of

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:29.540
of course

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:29.880
is

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.780
de

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.960
and so

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.580
with

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.100
a

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:35.900
card

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:36.360
of

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.360
would be

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:37.860
avec

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:38.180
une

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.520
carte

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:38.880
de

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.420
and credit

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:40.860
is

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.640
crédit

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.620
because the

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:43.200
T is not

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:43.660
pronounced

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.520
obviously

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.520
because it's

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:45.920
not in

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.100
for

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:46.480
luck

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.340
so one

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:47.500
more

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:47.900
time

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.480
with a

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.020
card

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:49.180

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:49.520

you

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:24.220
who

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:24.480
aren't

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:24.920
entirely

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.340
familiar

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:25.600
with

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:25.800
them

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.840
you'll

French

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.340

your

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.240
CDs

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.240
and

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:31.420
in

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:31.540
the

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.380
booklet

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.160
so

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:33.400
let's

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:33.720
begin

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.420
the

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:34.840
numbers

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.360
1

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:35.480
to

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:35.860
20

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.620
in

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.100
French

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:40.460
1

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:41.120
1

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.320
2

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.860
2

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:52.700
3

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.000
3

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.920
4

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.600
4

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.500
5

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.200
5

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:12.200
6

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.540
6

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.540
7

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.120
7

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.480
8

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.780
8

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.320
9

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.720
9

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:35.420
10

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:36.840
10

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.300
11

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.800
11

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.420
12

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.040
12

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.920
13

00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:00.260
14

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.540
14

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.320
14

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:06.260
15

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:06.380
15

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:07.780
15

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:33.860
15

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.060
16

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:35.400
16

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:45.600
And now all the numbers, 1 to 20.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:29.060
I think now you probably know enough in order to book yourself into a hotel room.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.700
Except just to make sure you really understand the French, you're going to do both parts.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:45.940
So, you're going to book yourself into a hotel and then you're going to work out what the likely response of the receptionist or the concierge is going to be.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:47.500
OK.

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:54.120
I want you to start by saying, I would like a room for two people for two nights.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.440
Je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes pour deux nuits.

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:11.260
The receptionist is going to respond by saying, I have a room for two people with shower.

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:19.820
J'ai une chambre pour deux personnes avec douche.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.260
Ask them how much it is by saying, it's how much.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:26.600
C'est combien?

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:36.660
They reply, for two nights with breakfast, a hundred euros.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.100
So, for two nights with breakfast.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:45.820
Pour deux nuits avec petit-déjeuner.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.580
One hundred euros.

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:50.640
Cent euros.

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.480
Again, notice the way euro is said in French.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:56.440
Euro.

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:57.340
OK.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.740
You need to get used to that pronunciation.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.880
If you do pronounce it in an English way, you will be understood, obviously, particularly in the context.

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.660
But do get some practice saying that.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:09.220
OK, so they've offered you the room.

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:13.140
You're now going to say, can I see it?

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.120
I can see it.

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.260
I can see her.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.080
Je peux la voir?

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.020
The receptionist, of course, says yes.

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.080
Oui.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:30.640
You go up to the room and, given the price, it's not bad.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.680
So, say, ah yes, it's perfect.

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.520
Ah oui, c'est parfait.

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:46.220
You go back down to the reception and the receptionist says, your name, please.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.380
How would you say that?

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.080
Votre nom, s'il vous plaît?

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.180
You may or may not be familiar with the word for please already in French.

00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.380
A lot of people are.

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.300
Literally, it means, if it pleases you.

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.440
And again, please in French is, s'il vous plaît.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.480
You'll be hearing it a lot during this course, so don't worry about it if you're not familiar with it already.

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.340
OK, now you've got to give your name.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.500
Now, that's interesting.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:27.240
Well, for the sake of argument, we're going to say you are called, let's say, Mr. or Mrs. Moon.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.820
That's a nice, simple name.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.720
And when you give your name in French, it is best to spell it afterwards.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:40.420
Because the pronunciation difference will often make it difficult for the French person to know how to spell the name.

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:46.480
The alphabet is given in this course at the end of the CDs, and you can check that later.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:47.980
It's also in the accompanying booklet.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.620
OK, so let's try and spell your name.

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.800
So first, give your surname, which is going to be Moon.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:55.900
Moon.

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.520
And then you're going to spell it.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:05.360
Now, I want you to spell it just so you would in English, but try to make the letter sound a bit more French.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.300
So how would you spell Moon in French?

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:07.380
Moon.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.300
M-O-O-N.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.280
Now, obviously, not all letters are going to be that easy in French, but some of them are.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.720
Some of them are just the same or very similar to the English.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:25.840
Again, the ones that are different, you can learn them with the last track on the CDs.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:27.880
OK.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.900
So you've given your name, and the receptionist is going to ask you, how are you paying?

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:34.720
How pay you?

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.080
How will she say that?

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.020
Comment payez-vous?

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.340
And you're going to reply to that and say, I can pay with a credit card.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.720
I can pay with a card of credit.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:01:00.600
Je peux payer avec une carte de crédit?

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.440
The receptionist says yes.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:05.560
Oui.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.140
You say thank you after she debits your card.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:11.540
Merci.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.080
And she, of course, will also say thank you.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:16.860
Merci.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:17.080
Merci.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:30.580
You may remember from the very, very beginning of the course, the French word for campsite.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:31.880
Do you remember what that was?

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.220
Le camping.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.800
So, to camp is...

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.200
Camper.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.600
But the campsite is...

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.240
Le camping.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.140
Do you remember what the weekend was?

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.420
Le weekend.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.380
So, again, there are groups of words that are quite similar to the English.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.860
What about the car park or parking lot?

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.260
Le parking.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.320
You'll notice a lot of them have ing on the end.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.420
Again, this is typical of words that have been imported to French.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:14.780
So, to say where is in French, where is, you will say...

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:15.200
Où est?

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.300
The et is the is that we've been using already.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.960
And where is...

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.140
Où.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.100
And where is together again is...

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:25.580
Où est?

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.480
So, how would you say where is the car park, where is the parking?

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.160
Où est le parking?

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.920
What was the campsite?

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:38.880
How do we say that?

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.120
Le camping.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.120
How would you say where is the campsite?

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.220
Où est le camping?

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.620
The word for there in French, there, is...

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:57.900
Là-bas.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.620
And you can also shorten it to...

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:01.840
Là.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.800
Là on its own really means there, just there.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.520
It's normally somewhere you can point to, typically.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.580
It's somewhere within pointing distance.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.980
And le bas means something closer to over there.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:23.180
The word bas on it, which is spelt B-A-S, is related to the English word base.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:30.240
So, when people in French say là-bas, it's like saying there at the base, down there, over there.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.400
And là on its own can just mean there.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.120
Both are very usable and là-bas is very commonly used.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:42.940
How would you say the campsite is over there?

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.840
Le camping est là-bas.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:58.200
You'll find that a lot of vocabulary for camping in French actually is the same as the English.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.880
A lot of it's very familiar.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.840
So, obviously, we have campsite, which is...

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:05.960
Camping.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:11.820
We have to camp, which is...

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.240
Camper.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.400
We have a tent, which is...

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.020
Une tente.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.080
Or a caravan, which is...

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:20.880
Une caravane.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.900
And so camping, using French, tends to be fairly easy.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.040
This is the end of CD2.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.860
The End of CD3.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:41.060
This is the end of CD3.
